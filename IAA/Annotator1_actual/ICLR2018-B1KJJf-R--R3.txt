"This paper introduces a technique for program synthesis involving a restricted grammar of problems that is beam-searched using an attentional encoder-decoder network. This work to my knowledge is the first to use a DSL closer to a full language.\n\nThe paper is very clear and easy to follow. One way it could be improved is if it were compared with another system. The results showing that guided search is a potent combination whose contribution would be made only stronger if compared with existing work."
