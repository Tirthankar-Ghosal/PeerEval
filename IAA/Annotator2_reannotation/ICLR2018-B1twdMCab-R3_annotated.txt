"The quality of this paper is good.[[OAL-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]] The presentation is clear but I find lack of description of a key topic.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEU,PNF-POS], [CRT], [MAJ]] The proposed model is not very innovative but works fine for the DQA task.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MAJ]] For the TE task, the proposed method does not perform better than the state-of-the-art systems.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n- As ESIM is one of the key components in the experiments, you should briefly introduce ESIM and explain how you incorporated with your vector representations into ESIM.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n- The reference of ESIM is not correct.[[BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- Figure 1 is hard to understand.[[TNF-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] What do you indicate with the box and arrow?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Arrows seem to have some different meanings.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] \n- What corpus did you use to pre-train word vectors?[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] \n- As the proposed method was successful for the QA task, you need to explain QA data sets and how the questions are solved.[[DAT-NEU,MET-POS], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n- I also expect performance and  error analysis of the task results.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]  \n- To claim \"task-agnostic\", you need to try to apply your method to other NLP tasks as well.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n- Page 3. \\Sigma is not defined.[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]"
