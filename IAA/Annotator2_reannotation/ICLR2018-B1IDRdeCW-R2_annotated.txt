"This paper presents three observations to understand binary network in Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016).[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,BIB-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] My main concerns are on the usage of the given observations.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] \n\n1. Can the observations be used to explain more recent works?[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nIndeed, Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016) is a good and pioneered work on the binary network.[[RWK-POS,BIB-NEU], [CMP-POS], [DIS], [MAJ]] However, as the authors mentioned, there are more recent works which give better performance than this one.[[RWK-POS,MET-NEU], [CMP-POS], [DIS], [MAJ]] For example, we can use +1, 0, -1 to approximate the weights.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Besides, [a] has also shown a carefully designed post-processing binary network can already give very good performance.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [DIS], [MAJ]] So, how can the given observations be used to explain more recent works?[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\n2. How can the given observations be used to improve Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016)?[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU,ANA-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nThe authors call their findings theory.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] From this perspective, I wish to see more mathematical analysis rather than just doing experiments and showing some interesting observations.[[EXP-NEG,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Besides, giving interesting observations is not good enough.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I wish to see how they can be used to improve binary networks.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nReference\n[a].
