{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper reports unusally rapid convergence of the ResNet-56 model on CIFAR-10 when a single cycle of a cyclic learning rate schedule is used.  The effect is analyzed from several different perspectives. However, the reviewers were not convinced because the effect is only observed for one task, so they question the significance of the result. There was significant discussion of the paper by the reviewers and area chair before this decision was reached.\n\nPros:\n+ Paper illustrates a \"super-convergence\" phenomenon in which training of a ResNet-56 reaches an accuracy of 92.4% on CIFAR-10 in 10,000 iterations using a single cycle of a cyclic learning rate schedule, while a more standard piecewise-constant schedule reaches 91.2% accuracy in 80,000 iterations.\n+ There was partial, independent replication of the results on other tasks reported on OpenReview.\n\nCons:\n- In the paper, the effect is shown for only one architecture and one task.\n- In the paper, the effect is shown for only a single run.\n- There are no error bars to indicate which differences are significant.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
