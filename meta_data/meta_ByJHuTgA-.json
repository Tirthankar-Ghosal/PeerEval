{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "this submission demonstrates an existing loop-hole (?) in rushing out new neural language models by carefully (and expensively) running hyperparameter tuning of baseline approaches. i feel this is an important contribution, but as pointed out by some reviewers, i would have liked to see whether the conclusion stands even with a more realistic data (as pointed out by some in the field quite harshly, perplexity on PTB should not be considered seriously, and i believe the same for the other two corpora used in this submission.) that said, it's an important paper in general which will work as an alarm to the current practice in the field, and i recommend it to be accepted.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
