{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents a new multi-document summarization task of trying to write a wikipedia article based on its sources. Reviewers found the paper and the task clear to understand and well-explained. The modeling aspects are clear as well, although lacking justification. Reviewers are split on the originality of the task, saying that it is certainly big, but wondering if that makes it difficult to compare with. The main split was the feeling that \"the paper presents strong quantitative results and qualitative examples. \" versus a frustration that the experimental results did not take into account extractive baselines or analysis. However the authors provide a significantly updated version of the work targeting many of these concerns, which does alleviate some of the main issues. For these reasons, despite one low review, my recommendation is that this work be accepted as a very interesting contribution.\n\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
