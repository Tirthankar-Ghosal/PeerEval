{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents a framework where GANs are used to improve detection of outliers (in this context, instances of the \u201cbackground class\u201d). This is a very interesting and, as demonstrated, promising idea. However, the general feeling of the reviewers is that more work is needed to make the technical and evaluations parts convincing. Suggestions for further work towards this direction include: theoretical analysis, better presentation of the manuscript and, most importantly, stronger experimental section. ", "decision": "Reject"}
