{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Predicting graphs is an interesting and important direction, and there exist essentially no (effective) general-purpose techniques for this problem.  The idea of predicting nodes one by one, though not entirely surprising, is interesting and the approach makes sense. Unfortunately, I (and some of reviewers) less convinced by evaluation:\n\n-  For example, evaluation on syntactic parsing of natural language is very weak. First of all, the used metric -- perplexity and exact match are non-standard and problematic (e.g., optimizing exact match would largely correspond to ignoring longer sentences where predicting the entire tree is unrealistic).  Also the exact match scores are very low (~30% whereas 45+ were achieve by models back in 2010).\n\n- A reviewer had, I believe, valid concerns about comparison with GrammarVAE, which were not fully addressed.\n\nOverall, I believe that it is interesting work, which regretfully cannot be published as a conference paper in its current form.\n\n+ important / under-explored problem\n+ a reasonable (though maybe not entirely surprising / original) approach\n- issues with evaluation\n\n", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
