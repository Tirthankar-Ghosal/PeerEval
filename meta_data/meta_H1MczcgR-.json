{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "An interesting analysis of the issue of short-horizon bias in meta-optimization that highlights a real problem in a number of existing setups. I concur with Reviewer 3 that it would be nice to provide a constructive solution to this issue: if something like K-FAC does indeed work well, it would be a great addition to a final version of this paper. Nonetheless, I think the paper would be a interesting addition to ICLR and recommend acceptance.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
