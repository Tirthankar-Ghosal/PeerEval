{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a novel method for training a non-autoregressive machine translation model based on a pre-trained auto-regressive model. The method is interesting and the evaluation is carried out well. It should be noted, however, that the relative complexity of the training procedure (which involves multiple stages and external supervision) might limit the practical applicability and impact of the technique.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
