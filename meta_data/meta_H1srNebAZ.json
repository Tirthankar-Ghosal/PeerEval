However, I find it to be a preliminary work and not yet ready for publication. The paper still lacks a conclusion / a leading hypothesis / an explanation for the shown results. I find this conclusion indispensable even for a small scientific study to be published.\" after the rebuttal. With scores of 7-5-4 it is just not possible for the AC to recommend acceptance.", "decision": "Reject"}
