{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This is an interesting paper that provides modeling improvements over several strong baselines and presents SOTA on Squad.  One criticism of the paper is that it evaluates only on Squad, which is somewhat of an artificial task, but we think for publication purposes at ICLR, the paper has a reasonable set of components.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
