{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The submission proposes optimization with hard-threshold activations.  This setting can lead to compressed networks, and is therefore an interesting setting if learning can be achieved feasibly.  This leads to a combinatorial optimization problem due to the non-differentiability of the non-linearity.  The submission proceeds to analyze the resulting problem and propose an algorithm for its optimization.\n\nResults show slight improvement over a recent variant of straight-through estimation (Hinton 2012, Bengio et al. 2013), called saturated straight-through estimation (Hubara et al., 2016).  Although the improvements are somewhat modest, the submission is interesting for its framing of an important problem and improvement over a popular setting.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
