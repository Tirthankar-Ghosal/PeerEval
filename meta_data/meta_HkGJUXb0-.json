{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes a new way of learning tensors representation with ring-structured decompositions rather than through Tensor Train methods. The paper investigates the mathematical properties of this decomposition and provides synthetic experiments. There was some debate, with the reviewers, about the novelty and impact of this method, where overall the feeling was this work was too preliminary to be accepted. The idea, from my understanding, is interesting and would benefit from discussion at the workshop track, but the authors are investigated to make a stronger case for the novelty of this method in any further work and, in particular, to consider showing empirical improvement on \"real\" data where TT methods are currently applied.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
