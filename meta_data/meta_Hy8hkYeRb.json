{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper attempts to develop a method for learning latent representations using deep predictive coding and deconvolutional networks. However, the theoretical motivation for the proposed model in relation to existing methods (such as original predictive coding, deconvolutional networks, ladder networks, etc.), as well as the empirical comparison against them is unclear. The experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset do not provide much insight on what kind of meaningful/improved representations can be learned in comparison to existing methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. No rebuttal was provided. ", "decision": "Reject"}
