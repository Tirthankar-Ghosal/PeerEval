{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper is a timely application of linear algebra to propose a method for reducing catastrophic interference by training a new task in a subspace of the parameter space using conceptors. The conceptors are deployed in the backprop, making this a valuable alternative to recent continual learning methods such as EWC. The paper is clearly written and the results give a clear validation of the method. The reviewers agree as to the merits of the paper.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
