{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Given that the paper proposes a new evaluation scheme for generative models, I agree with the reviewers that it is essential that the paper compare with existing metrics (even if they are imperfect). The choice of datasets was very limited as well, given the nature of the paper. I acknowledge that the authors took care to respond in detail to each of the reviews.", "decision": "Reject"}
