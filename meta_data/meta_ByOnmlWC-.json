{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "At least two of the reviewers found the proposed approach novel and interesting and worthy of publication at ICLR. The reviewers raised concerns regarding the paper's terminology, which may lead to some misunderstanding. I agree that upon a quick skim, a reader may think that the paper performs the crossover operation outlined at the bottom right of Figure 1. Please consider improving the figure and the caption to prevent such a misunderstanding. You can even slightly change the title to reflect the policy distillation operation rather than naive crossover. Finally, including some more complex baselines benefits the paper. I am curious whether performing policy gradient on an ensemble of 8 policies + periodic removal of the bottom half of the policies will provide similar gains.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
