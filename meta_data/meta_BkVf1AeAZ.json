{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes an approach for jointly learning a label embedding and prediction network, as a way of taking advantage of relationships between labels.  This general idea is well-motivated, but the specifics of the proposed approach are not motivated or described well.  More discussion of relationship with prior work (e.g. other ways of \"softening\" the softmax) is needed.  The authors claim to have state-of-the-art results, but reviewers point out that much better results exist.", "decision": "Reject"}
