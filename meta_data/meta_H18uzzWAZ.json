{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This is a nice but very narrow study of domain invariance in a microscopic imaging application.  Since the problem is very general, the paper should include much more substantial context, e.g. discussion of various alternative methods (e.g. the ones cited in Sun et al. 2017).  In order to contribute to the broader ICLR community, ideally the paper would also include application to more than just the one task.", "decision": "Reject"}
