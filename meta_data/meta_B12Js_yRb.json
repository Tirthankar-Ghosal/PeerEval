{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Initially this paper received mixed reviews. After reading the author response, R1 and and R3 recommend acceptance.\n\nR2, who recommended rejecting the paper, did not participate in discussions, did not respond to author explanations, did not respond to AC emails, and did not submit a final recommendation. This AC does not agree with the concerns raised by R2 (e.g. I don't find this model to be unprincipled).\n\nThe concerns raised by R1 and R3 were important (especially e.g. comparisons to NMS) and the authors have done a good job adding the required experiments and providing explanations.\n\nPlease update the manuscript incorporating all feedback received here, including comparisons reported to the concurrent ICLR submission on counting.
