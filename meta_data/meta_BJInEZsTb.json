{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper compares autoencoder and GAN-based methods for 3D point cloud representation and generation, as well as new (and welcome) metrics for quantitatively evaluating generative models.  The experiments form a good but still a bit too incomplete exploration of this topic.  More analysis is needed to calibrate the new metrics.  Qualitative analysis would be very helpful here to complement and calibrate the quantitative ones.  The writing also needs improvement for clarity and verbosity.  The author replies and revisions are very helpful, but there is still some way to go on the issues above. Overall, the committee is intersting and recommends this paper for the workshop track.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
