{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Authors present a method for representing DNA sequence reads as one-hot encoded vectors, with genomic context (expected original human sequence), read sequence, and CIGAR string (match operation encoding) concatenated as a single input into the framework. Method is developed on 5 lung cancer patients and 4 melanoma patients.\n\n\nPros:\n- The approach to feature encoding and network construction for task seems new.\n- The target task is important and may carry significant benefit for healthcare and disease screening.\n\nCons:\n- The number of patients involved in the study is exceedingly small. Though many samples were drawn from these patients, pattern discovery may not be generalizable across larger populations. Though the difficulty in acquiring this type of data is noted.\n- (Significant) Reviewer asked for use of public benchmark dataset, for which authors have declined to use since the benchmark was not targeted toward task of ultra-low VAFs. However, perhaps authors could have sourced genetic data from these recommended public repositories to create synthetic scenarios, which would enable the broader research community to directly compare against the methods presented here. The use of only private datasets is concerning regarding the future impact of this work.\n- (Significant) The concatenation of the rows is slightly confusing. It is unclear why these were concatenated along the column dimension, rather than being input as multiple channels. This question doesn't seem to be addressed in the paper.\nGiven the pros and cons, the commitee recommends this interesting paper for workshop.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
