{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper is intersting but has a few flaws that still need to be addressed. As one reviewer noted, \"the authors seems to have simply applied the method of Andrychowicz et al. If they added some discussion and experiments clearly showing why this is a better way to improve the existing inference methods, the paper might have more impact.\".\nOverall, this work builds on existing work, but does not really dig deep enough for answers to these questions raised by the reviewers. The committee still feels this paper will be of great value at ICLR and recommends it for a workshop paper.\n", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
