{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "  + Original regularizer that encourages discriminator representation entropy is shown to improve GAN training.\n  + good supporting empirical validation\n  - While intuitively reasonable, no compelling theory is given to justify the approach\n  - The regularizer used in practice is a heap of heuristic approximations (continuous relaxation of a rough approximate measure of the joint entropy of a binarized activation vector)\n  - The writing and the mathematical exposition could be clearer and more precise", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
