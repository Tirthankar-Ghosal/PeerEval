{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a method to robustify neural networks which is an important problem. They uses ideas from causality and create a model that would only depend on \"stable\" features ignoring the easy to manipulate ones. The paper has some interesting ideas, however, the main concern is regarding insufficient comparison to existing literature. One of the reviewers also has concerns regarding novelty of the approach.", "decision": "Reject"}
