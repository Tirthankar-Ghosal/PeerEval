{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers agreed that this paper is not quite ready for publication at ICLR.  One of the reviewers thought the paper was well written and easy to follow while the two others said the opposite.  One of the main criticisms was issues with the composition.  The paper seems to lack a clear formal explanation of the problem and the proposed methodology.  The reviewers in general weren't convinced by the experiments, complaining about the lack of a required baseline and that the proposed method doesn't seem to significantly help in the experiment presented.\n\nPros:\n- The proposed idea is interesting\n- The problem is timely and of interest to the community\n- Addresses multiple important problems at the intersection of ML and RL in sequence generation\n\nCons:\n- Novel but somewhat incremental\n- The experiments are not compelling (i.e. the results are not strong)\n- A necessary baseline is missing\n- Significant issues with the writing - both in terms of clarity and correctness.", "decision": "Reject"}
