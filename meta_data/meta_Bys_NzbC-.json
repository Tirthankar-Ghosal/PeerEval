{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The submission is motivated by an empirical observation of a phase transition when a sufficiently high L1 or L2 penalty on the weights is applied.  The proposed solution is to optimize for several epochs without the penalty followed by introduction of the penalty.  Although empirical results seem to moderately support this approach, there does not seem to be sufficient theoretical justification, and comparisons are missing.  Furthermore, the author response to reviewer concerns contain unclear statements e.g.\n\"The reason is that, to reach the level of L1 norm that is low enough, the model needs to go through the strong regularization for the first few epochs, and the neurons already lose its learning ability during this period like the baseline method.\"\nIt is not at all clear what \"neurons already lose its learning ability\" is supposed to mean.", "decision": "Reject"}
