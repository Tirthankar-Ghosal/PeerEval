Important and challenging topic to analyze and any progress on unsupervised learning is interesting.\n2. the paper is clear, although more formalization would help sometimes\n3.

Some concerns about whether the claims are sufficiently justified in the experiments\n2. The paper is very long and quite dense\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
