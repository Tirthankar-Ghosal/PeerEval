{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper presents a layered image generation model  (e.g., foreground vs background) using GANs. The high-level idea is interesting, but novelty is somewhat limited. For example, layered generation with VAE/GAN has been explored in Yan et al. 2016 (VAEs) and Vondrick et al. 2016 (GANs). In addition, there are earlier works for unsupervised learning of foreground/background generative models (e.g., Le Roux et al., Sohn et al.). Another critical problem is that only qualitative results on relatively simple datasets (e.g., MNIST, SVHN, CelebA) are provided as experimental results. More quantitative evaluations and additional experiments on more challenging datasets will strengthen the paper.\n\n* N. Le Roux, N. Heess, J. Shotton, J.
