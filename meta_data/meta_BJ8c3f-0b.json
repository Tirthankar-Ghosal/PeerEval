{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This work develops importance weighted autoencoder-like training but with sequential Monte Carlo.  The paper is interesting, well written and the methods are very timely (there are two highly related concurrent papers -  Naesseth et al. and Maddison et al.).  Initially, the reviewers shared concerns about the technical details of the paper, but the authors appear to addressed those and two reviews have been raised accordingly.   There is one outlier review (two 7s and one 3).  The 3 is the least thorough and has the lowest confidence (2) so that review is being weighted accordingly.\n\nThis appears to be a timely and interesting paper that is interesting to the community and warrants publication at ICLR.\n\nPros:\n- Well written and clear\n- An interesting approach\n- Neat technical innovations\n- Generative deep models are of great interest to the community (e.g. Variational Autoencoders)\n\nCons:\n- Could include a better treatment of recent related literature\n- Leaves a variety of open questions about specific details (i.e. from the reviews)", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
