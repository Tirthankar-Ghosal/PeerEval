{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper studies the robustness of deep learning against label noise on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. But the generalization of the claim \"deep learning is robust to massive label noise\" is still questionable due to the limited noise types investigated.\nThe paper presents some tricks to improve learning with high label noise (batch size and learning rate), which is not novel enough.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
