{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes to launch adversarial attacks in the latent space of VAE such that the minimal change in the latent representation leads to the decoder producing an image with class predictions altered.  Given the pros/cons the paper in its current form falls short of acceptance.\n\nPros:\nReviewers agree that the paper is well written and easy to follow\n\nCons:\n- The paper lacks novelty and uses standard attacks and defense methodology.\n- Reviewers find the attack scenario presented is unrealistic and hence may not useful.\n- Experiments lack rigorous comparisons with baselines and it is not clear if the attack in the latent space will be stronger than the attack in the input space. ", "decision": "Reject"}
