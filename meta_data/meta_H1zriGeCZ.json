{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper introduces an algorithm for optimization of discrete hyperparameters based on compressed sensing, and compares against standard gradient-free optimization approaches.\n\nAs the reviewers point out, the provable guarantees (as is usually the case) don't quite make it to the main results section, but are still refreshing to see in hyperparameter optimization.\n\nThe method itself is relatively simple compared to full-featured Bayesopt (spearmint), although not as widely applicable.\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
