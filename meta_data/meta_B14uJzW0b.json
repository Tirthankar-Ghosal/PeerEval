{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This submission is a continuation of a line of theoretical work that seeks to characterize optimization landscapes of neural networks by the presence or absence of spurious local minima.  As the number of critical points grows combinatorially for larger networks, it is very challenging to show such results.  The present submission extends slightly previous work by considering two hidden units and their proof technique goes beyond that of Brutzkus and Globerson, 2017, potentially leading to more interesting results if they can be extended to more complex networks.\n\nThe setting of two hidden units is quite limited - far from any practical setting.  If this were the stepping stone to proving optimality of certain optimization strategies for more complex networks, this may be of some interest, but it seems doubtful.  One indication is given in Sec. 7 / Fig. 1 in which it is shown that for even quite small numbers of hidden units, spurious local optima do occur and are reached 40% of the time for random initializations even with only 11 nodes.\n\n", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
