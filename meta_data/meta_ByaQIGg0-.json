{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Differentiable neural networks used as a measure of design optimality in order to improve efficiency of automated design.\n\n\nPros:\n- Genetic algorithms, which are the dominant optimization routine for automated design systems, can be computationally expensive. This approach alleviates this bottleneck under certain circumstances and applications.\n\nCons:\n- Primarily application paper, machine learning advancement is marginal.\n- Multiple reviewers: Generalization capability not clear. For example, some utility systems may be stochastic (i.e. turbulence) and require multiple trials to measure fitness, which this method would not be able to model.\nOverall, the committee feels this paper is interesting enough to appears as a workshop paper.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
