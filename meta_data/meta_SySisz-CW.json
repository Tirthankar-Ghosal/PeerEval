{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Thank you for submitting you paper to ICLR. The paper presents an interesting analysis, but the utility of this analysis is questionable e.g. it is not clear how this might lead to improved VAEs/GANs. The authors did add an additional experimental result in their revised paper, but questions still remain. In light of this the significance of the paper is on the low side and it is therefore not ready for publication in ICLR without more work.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
