{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper creates a dataset for exploration of RL for molecular design and I think this makes it a strong contribution to the community at the intersection of the two. For a methods focussed conference such as ICLR however, it may not be the best fit. Hence I would recommend submitting to a workshop track or targeting a more focussed venue such as a bioinformatics conference. ", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
