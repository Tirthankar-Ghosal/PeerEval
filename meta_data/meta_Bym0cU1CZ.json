{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This work takes dialogue acts into account to generate responses in a human-machine conversation. However, incorporating dialogue acts into open-domain dialogue was already the focus of Zhao et al's ACL 2017 paper, Learning Discourse-level Diversity for Neural Dialog Models using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, and using dialogue acts in a policy for human-machine conversation was also an idea that already appeared in Serban et al 2017, A Deep Reinforcement Learning Chatbot. Despite the authors' response that tries to adjust their claims and incorporate a more thorough overview, I encourage the authors to re-work their research with a much more careful and reliable examination of previous work and how their effort should be understood in that more comprehensive context.", "decision": "Reject"}
