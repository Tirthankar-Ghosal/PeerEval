{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper introduces a student-teacher method for learning from labels of varying quality (i.e. varying fidelity data). This is an interesting idea which shows promising results.\n\nSome further connections to various kinds of semi-supervised and multi-fidelity learning would strengthen the paper, although understandably it is not easy to cover the vast literature, which also spans different scientific domains. One reviewer had a concern about some design decisions that seemed ad-hoc, but at least the authors have intuitively and experimentally justified them.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
