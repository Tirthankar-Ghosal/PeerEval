{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers agree that the manuscript is below the acceptance threshold at ICLR.  Many points of criticism were evident in the reviewer comments, including small artificial test domain, no new methods introduced, poor writing in some places, and dubious need for DeepRL in this domain.  The reviews mentioned a number of constructive comments to improve the paper, and we hope this will provide useful guidance for the authors to rewrite and resubmit to a future venue.", "decision": "Reject"}
