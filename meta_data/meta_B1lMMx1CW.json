{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Meta score: 6\n\nThis is a thorough empirical paper, demonstrating the effectiveness of a relatively simple model for recommendations:\n\nPros:\n - strong experiments\n - always good to see simple models pushed to perform well\n - presumably of interest to practioners in the area\n\nCons:\n - quite oriented to the recommendation application\n - technical novelty is in the experimental evaluation rather than any new techniques\n\nOn balance I recommend the paper is invited to the workshop.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
