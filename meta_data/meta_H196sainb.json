{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "There is significant discussion on this paper and high variance between reviewers:  one reviewer gave the paper a low score.  However the committee feels that this paper should be accepted at the conference since it provides a better framework for reproducibility, performs more large scale experiments than prior work.  One small issue the lack of comparison in terms of empirical results between this work and Zhang et al's work, but the responses provided to both the reviewers and anonymous commenters seem to be satisfactory.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
