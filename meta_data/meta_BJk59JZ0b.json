{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers agree that the formulation is novel and interesting, but they raised concerns regarding the motivation and the complexity of the approach. I find the authors' response mostly satisfying, and I ask them to improve the paper by incorporating the comments.\n\nDetailed comments:\nThe maximum-entropy objective used in Eq. (13) reminds me of maximum-entropy RL objective in previous work including [Ziebart, 2010], [Azar, 12], [Nachum, 2017], and [Haarnoja, 2017].", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
