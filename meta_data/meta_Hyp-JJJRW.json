{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": " + Paper proposes simple joint deep autoencoder + classifier training where the hidden representation is split between (observed) class and (unobserved) style nodes.\n - Empirical evaluation is very limited, focusing on only qualitative evaluation of reconstructions and interpolations (on MNIST and EMNIST).\n - Unclear goal: if it is improving classifier robustness, then quantitative classifier robustness improvements should be experimentally demonstrated. If it is as a (conditional) generative model, then it should be compared to strong generative baselines (in the GVAE or GAN families). The paper currently has neither.", "decision": "Reject"}
