Reviewers like the work but have some criticisms. Particularly in terms of its originality and potential significance  noting \"It is a good incremental research, but the downside of this paper is lack of innovations since most of the methods proposed in this paper are not new to us.\". Still reviewers note the experimental results are of high quality performing excellent on several datasets and building \"a strong summarization model.\" Furthermore the model is extensively tested including in \"human readability and relevance assessments \".  The work itself is well written and clear.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
