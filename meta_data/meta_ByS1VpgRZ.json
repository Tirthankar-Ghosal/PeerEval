{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a simple modification to conditional GANs, where the discriminator involves an inner product term between the condition vector y and the feature vector of x. This formulation is reasonable and well motivated from popular models (e.g., log-linear, Gaussians). Experimentally, the proposed method is evaluated on conditional image generation and super-resolution tasks, demonstrating improved qualitative and qualitative performance over the existing state-of-the-art (AC-GAN).\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
