{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper introduces a GAN-based framework for inferring human category representations. The reviewers agree that the idea is interesting and well-motivated, and the results are promising. The technical contribution is not significant, but nevertheless the paper combines existing ideas in an interesting way. The reviewers would also like to see some more work towards the direction of investigation of the results and extraction of insights, without which the paper feels somehow incomplete.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
