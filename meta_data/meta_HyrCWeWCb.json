{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper adapts (Nachum et al 2017) to continuous control via TRPO.   The work is incremental (not in the dirty sense of the word popular amongst researchers, but rather in the sense of \"building atop a closely related work\"), nontrivial,  and shows empirical promise.    The reviewers would like more exploration of the sensitivity of the hyper-parameters.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
