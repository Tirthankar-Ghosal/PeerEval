{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "meta score: 8\n\nThe paper present a distributed architecture using prioritized experience replay for deep reinforcement learning.  It is well-written and the experimentation is extremely strong.  The main issue is the originality - technically, it extends previous work in a limited way;  the main contribution is practical, and this is validated by the experiments.  The experimental support is such that the paper has meaningful conclusions and will surely be of interest to people working in the field.  Thus I would say it is comfortably over the acceptance threshold.\n\nPros:\n - good motivation and literature review\n - strong experimentation\n - well-written and clearly presented\n - details in the appendix are very helpful\nCons:\n - possibly limited originality in terms of modelling advances\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
