{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers agree that while the presented result looks interesting, it is but one result. Further, one of the reviewer finds this to be a weak comparison as well.\nThe novelty of the approach over the paper by Ba et. al. also is in question -- good results on multiple tasks might have made it worth exploring, but the authors did not establish this to be the case convincingly.", "decision": "Reject"}
