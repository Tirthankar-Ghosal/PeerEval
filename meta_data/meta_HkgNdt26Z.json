{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The committee feels that this paper presents a simple, yet effective way to adapt language models from various users in a sufficiently privacy preserving way.  Empirical results are quite strong.  Reviewer 3 says that the novelty of the paper is not great, but does not provide any references to prior work that are similar to this paper.  The meta-reviewer finds the responses to Reviewer 3 sufficient to address the concerns.\n\nSimilarly, Reviewer 2 says that the paper may not be relevant to ICLR, but the committee feels its content does belong to the conference since the topic is extremely relevant to modern language processing techniques.  In fact, the authors provide several references that show that this paper is similar in content to those submissions.\n\nReviewer 1's concerns are also not sufficiently strong to warrant rejection.  The responses to each criticism suffices and the meta-reviewer thinks that this paper will add value to the conference.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
