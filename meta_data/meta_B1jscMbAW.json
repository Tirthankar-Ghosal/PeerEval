{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a unique network architecture that can learn divide-and-conquer strategies to solve algorithmic tasks, mimicking a class of standard algorithms.  The paper is clearly written, and the experiments are diverse.  It also seems to point in the direction of a wider class of algorithm-inspired neural net architectures.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
