{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Authors present a method for modeling neurodegenerative diseases using a multitask learning framework that considers \"censored regression\" problems (to model where the outputs have discrete values and ranges). Given the pros/cons, the committee feels this paper is not ready for acceptance in its current state.\n\n\nPro:\n- This approach to modeling discrete regression problems is interesting and may hold potential, but the evaluation is not in a state where strong meaningful conclusions can be made.\n\nCon:\n- Reviewers raise multiple concerns regarding evaluation and comparison standards for tasks. While authors have added some model comparisons in response, in other areas comparisons don't appear complete. For example, when using MRI data, networks compared all use features derived from images, rather than systems that may learn from images themselves. Authors claim dataset is too small to learn directly from pixels in this data (in comments), but transfer learning and data augmentation have been successfully applied to learn from datasets of this size. In addition, new multitask techniques in the imaging domain have also been presented that dynamically learn the network structure, rather than relying on a hand-crafted neural network design. How this approach would compare is not addressed.\n\n\n", "decision": "Reject"}
