{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This is a (question answering) dataset paper with some baseline models.\n\nThe evaluation metric seems far from ideal and not quite ready for prime-time yet. They use F1 and Exact Match - these metrics make sense for extractive question answering systems, they don't make sense IMO for abstractive systems where the answer can be generated by the model (BLEU-type eval metrics seem more appropriate).\n\nI therefore recommend this work for the workshop track.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
