{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper studies to what extent adversarial training affects the properties of adversarial examples in object classification.\n\nReviewers found the work going in the right direction, but agreed that it needs further evidence/focus in order to constitute a significant contribution to the ICLR community. In particular, the AC encourages authors to relate their work to the growing body of (mostly concurrent) work on robust optimization and adversarial learning. For the above reasons, the AC recommends rejection at this time. ", "decision": "Reject"}
