{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper sets out to analyze the problem of exploding gradients in deep nets which is of fundamental importance. Reviewers largely acknowledge the novelty of the main ideas in the paper towards this goal, however it is also strongly felt that the writing/presentation of the paper needs significant improvement to make it into a coherent and clean story before it can be published. There are also some concerns on networks used in the experiments not being close to practice.\n\nI recommend invitation to the workshop track as it has novel ideas and will likely generate interesting discussion.
