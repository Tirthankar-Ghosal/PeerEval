{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents a GAN training algorithm motivated by online learning. The method is shown to converge to a mixed Nash equilibrium in the case of a shallow discriminator. In the initial version of the paper, reviewers had concerns about weak baselines in the experiments, but the updated version includes comparisons against a variety of modern GAN architectures which have been claimed to fix mode dropping. This seems to address the main criticism of the reviewers. Overall, this paper seems like a worthwhile addition to the GAN literature.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
