{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers agree this is a really interesting paper, with an interesting idea (in particular\nthe use of regret clipping might provide a benefit over typical policy gradient methods). However,\nthere are two major concerns: 1) clarity / exposition and more importantly 2) lack of a strong\nempirical motivation for the new approach (why do standard methods work just as well on these\npartially observable domains?).", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
