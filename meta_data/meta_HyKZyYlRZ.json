{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "\nPros:\n+ Interesting and promising approach to multi-domain, multi-task learning.\n+ Paper is clearly written.\n\nCons:\n- Reads more like a technical report than a research paper: more space should be devoted to explaining the design decisions behind the model and the challenges involved, as this will help others tackle similar problems.\n\nThis paper had extensive discussion between the reviewers and authors, and between the reviewers.  In the end, the reviewers want more insight into the architectural choices made, either via ablation studies or via a series of experiments in which tasks or components are added one at a time.  The consensus is that this would give readers a lot more insight into the challenges involved in tackling multiple domains and multiple tasks in a single model and a lot more guidance on how to do it.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
