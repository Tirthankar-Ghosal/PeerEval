{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The key concern from the reviewers that was not addressed is that none of the experimental results illustrate convergence vs. time instead of convergence vs. number of iterations.  While the authors point out that their method is O(ND) instead of O(KND), the reviewers really wanted to see graphs demonstrating this, given that the implicit SGD method requires an iterative solver. The revised paper is otherwise much improved from the original submission, but falls a bit short of ICLR acceptance because of the lack of a measurement of convergence vs. time.\n\nPros:\n+ Promising unbiased algorithms for optimizing the log-likelihood of a model using a softmax without having to repeatedly compute the normalizing factor.\n\nCons:\n- The key concern from the reviewers that was not addressed is that none of the experimental results illustrate convergence vs. time instead of convergence vs. number of iterations.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
