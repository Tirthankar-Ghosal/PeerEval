{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes a method for quantitatively evaluating GANs. Better quantitative metrics for GANs are badly needed, as the field is being held back by excessive focus on generated samples. This paper proposes to estimate the Wasserstein distance to the data distribution. A paper which does this well would be a significant contribution, but unfortunately (as the reviewers point out) the experimental validation in this paper seems insufficient.\n\nTo be convincing, a paper would first need to demonstrate the ability to accurately estimate Wasserstein distance -- not an easy task, but one which receives little mention in this paper. Then it would need to validate that the method can either quantitatively confirm known results about GANs or uncover previously unknown phenomena. As it stands, I don't think this submission is ready for publication in ICLR, but I'd encourage resubmission after more careful experimental validation along the lines suggested by the reviewers.\n\n", "decision": "Reject"}
