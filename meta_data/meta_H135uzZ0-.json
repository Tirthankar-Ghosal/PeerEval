{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Mixed precision application of CNNs is being explored for e.g. hardware implementations of networks trained at full precision.  Mixed precision at training time is less common.  This submission primarily concerns itself with the practical implementation details of training with mixed precision, and focuses primarily on representation of mixed precision floating point and algorithmic issues for learning.  In the end the support for the approach is primarily empirical, with the mixed precision approach giving a factor of two speedup with half the precision, while accuracies remain effectively statistically tied on the ImageNet 1k database.  Table 1 should avoid the use of bold as there is likely no statistical significance.\n\nThe reviewers appreciated the paper. The proposed approach is sensible, and appears correct.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
