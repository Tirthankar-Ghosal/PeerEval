{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewer scores are fairly close, and the comments in their reviews are likewise similar.  All reviewers indicate that they find this to be an interesting learning domain.  However, they also agree in assessing the proposed method as having limited novelty and significance.  They also critiqued the empirical evaluation as being too specific to Starcraft and not comprehensive, without providing evidence that the defogger contributes to winning at StarCraft.  The authors wrote a substantial rebuttal to the reviews, but it did not convince anyone to increase their scores.", "decision": "Reject"}
