{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper forms a good contribution to the active area of adversarial training.  The main issue with the original submission was presentation quality and excessive length.  The revised version is much improved.  However, it still needs some work on the writing, in large part in the transferability section but also to clean up a large number of non-native formulations like missing/extra determiners and some awkward phrasing.  It should be carefully proofread by a native English speaker if possible.  Also, the citation formatting is incorrect (frequently using \\citet instead of \\citep).", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
