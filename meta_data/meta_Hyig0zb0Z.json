{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Pros\n-- Competitive results on LibriSpeech.\nCons\n-- Limited novelty, and lacks enough comparisons.\n-- Comparison with other end-to-end approaches, and on other commonly used datasets, like WSJ, missing.\n-- Gated convnets have already been proposed.\n-- Letter based systems have been shown to be competitive to phone based systems.\n-- Optimization criterion is quite similar to lattice-free MMI proposed by Povey et al., but with a letter based LM and a slightly different HMM topology.\n\nGiven the cons pointed out by reviews, the AC is recommending that the paper be rejected.\n\f\n", "decision": "Reject"}
