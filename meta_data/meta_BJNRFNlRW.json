{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper makes a good theoretical contribution by formulating the GAN training as primal-dual subgradient method for convex optimization and providing convergence proof. The authors then propose a modified objective to standard GAN training, based on this formulation, that helps address the mode collapse issue.\nOne weak point of the paper as pointed out by reviewers is that that the experimental results are underwhelming and the approach may not scale well to high dimensional datasets / high-resolution images. Interestingly, the proposed approach is general enough to be applied to other GAN variants that may address this issue in future. I recommend acceptance.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
