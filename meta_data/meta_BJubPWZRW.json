{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper combines ideas from student-teacher training and multi-view learning in a simple but clever way.  There is not much novelty in the methods, but promising results are given across several tasks, including realistic NLP tasks.  The improvements are not huge but are consistent.  Considering the limited novelty, the paper should include some more convincing analysis and insight on why/when the approach works. Given the intersting results, the committee recommends this for workshop track.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
