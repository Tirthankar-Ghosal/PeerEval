{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers think that the theoretical contribution is not significant on its own. The reviewers find the empirical aspect of the paper interesting, but more analysis of the empirical behavior is required, especially for large datasets. Even for small datasets with input augmentation (e.g. random crops in CIFAR-10) the pre-processing can become prohibitive. I recommend improving the manuscript for a re-submission to another venue and an ICLR workshop presentation.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
