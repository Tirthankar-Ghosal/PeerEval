{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Pros\n-- Shows alternative strategies to train low-rank factored weight matrices for recurrent nets.\n\nCons\n-- Minor modifications (and gains) over other forms of regularization like L2.\n-- Results are only on an ASR task, so it\u2019s not entirely clear how they\u2019ll work on other tasks.\n\nAs pointed out by the reviewers, unless the authors show that the techniques generalize well to other tasks, and larger datasets it hard to accept it to the main conference. The AC, therefore, recommends that the paper be rejected.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
