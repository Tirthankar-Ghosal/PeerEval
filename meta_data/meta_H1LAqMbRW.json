{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "There was certainly some interest in this paper which investigates learning latent models of the environment for model-based planning, particularly articulated by Reviewer3.  However, the bulk of reviewer remarks focused on negatives, such as:\n\n--The model-based approach is disappointing compared to the model-free approach.\n--The idea of learning a model based on the features from a model-free agent seems novel but lacks significance in that the results are not very compelling.\n--I feel the paper overstates the results in saying that the learned forward model is usable in MCTS.\n-- the paper in it\u2019s current form is not written well and does not contain strong enough empirical results\n\n\n", "decision": "Reject"}
