{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper considers learning an NMT systems while pivoting through images. The task is formulated as a referential game. From the modeling and set-up perspective it is similar to previous work in the area of emergent communication / referential games, e.g., Lazaridou et al (ICLR 17) and especially to Havrylov & Titov (NIPS 17), as similar techniques are used to handle the variable-length channel (RNN encoders / decoders + the ST Gumbel-Softmax estimator).  However, its multilingual version is interesting and the results are sufficiently convincing (e.g., comparison to Nakayama and Nishida, 17). The paper would more attractive for those interested in emergent communication than the NMT community, as the set-up (using pivoting through images) may be perceived somewhat exotic by the NMT community. Also, the model is not attention-based (unlike SoA in seq2seq / NMT), and it is not straightforward to incorporate attention (see R2 and author response).\n\n+ an interesting framing of the weakly-supervised MT problem\n+ well written\n+ sufficiently convincing results\n- the set-up and framework (e.g., non-attention based) is questionable from practical perspective\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
