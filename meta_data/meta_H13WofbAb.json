{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper introduces a method for making synchronous SGD more resistant to failed or slow workers. The idea seems plausible, but as the reviewers point out, the novelty and the experimental validation are somewhat limited. For a contribution such as this, it would be good to see some experiments on a wider range of tasks, and experiments with real rather than simulated workloads. I don't think this work is ready for publication at ICLR.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
