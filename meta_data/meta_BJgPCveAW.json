{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper received weak scores: 4,4,5. R2 complained about clarity. R3's point about the lack of fully connected layers in current SOA deepnets is very valid and the authors response far from convincing. Unfortunately the major revision provided by the authors was not commented on by the reviewers, but many of the major shortcomings of the work still remain.\nGenerally, the paper is below the acceptance threshold, so cannot be accepted.", "decision": "Reject"}
