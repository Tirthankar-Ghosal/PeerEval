{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes augmenting Neural Statistician with a meta-context variable that specifies the partitioning of the latent context into the per-dataset and per-datapoint dimensions. This idea makes a lot of sense but the reviewers found the experimental section clearly insufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness convincingly. Also introducing only the unsupervised version of the model, which looks challenging to train, but performing all the experiments with the less interesting semi-supervised version makes the paper both less compelling and harder to follow.", "decision": "Reject"}
