{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The presented work is a good attempt to expand the work of Li and Malik to the high-dimensional, stochastic setting. Given the reviewer comments, I think the paper would benefit from highlighting the comparatively novel aspects, and in particular doing so earlier in the paper.\n\nIt is very important, given the nature of this work, to articulate how the hyperparameters of the learned optimizers, and of the hand-engineered optimizers are chosen. It is also important to ensure that the amount of time spent on each is roughly equal in order to facilitate an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nThe chosen architectures are still quite small compared to today's standards. It would be informative to see how the learned optimizers compare on realistic architectures, at least to see the performance gap.\n\nPlease clarify the objective being optimized, and it would be useful to report test error.\n\nThe approach is interesting, but does not yet meet the threshold required for acceptance.", "decision": "Reject"}
