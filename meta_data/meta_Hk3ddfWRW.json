{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents a sampling inference method for learning in multi-modal demonstration scenarios. Reference to imitation learning causes some confusion with the IRL domain, where this terminology is usually encountered. Providing a real application to robot reaching, while a relatively simple task in robotics, increases the difficulty and complexity of the demonstration. That makes it impressive, but also difficult to unpick the contributions and reproduce even the first demonstration. It's understandable at a meeting on learning representations that the reviewers wanted to understand why existing methods for learning multi-modal distributions would not work, and get a better understanding of the tradeoffs and limitations of the proposed method. The CVAE comparison added to the appendix during the rebuttal period just pushed this paper over the bar. The demonstration is simplified, so much easier to reproduce, making it more feasible others will attempt to reproduce the claims made here.\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
