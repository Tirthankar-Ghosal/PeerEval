{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper builds on earlier work by Wang et al (2015) on Visual Concepts (VCs) and explores the use of VCs for few-shot learning setting for novel classes.\n\nThe work, as pointed out by two reviewers is somewhat incremental in nature, with main novelty being the demonstration of utilities of VCs for few shot learning. This would not have been a big limitation if the paper had a carefully conducted empirical evaluation providing insights on the effect of various configuration settings/hyperparameters on the performance in few shot learning, which two of the reviewers (Anon3, Anon2) state are missing. The paper falls short of the acceptance threshold in its current form.\n\nPS: The authors posted a github link to the code on Jan 12 which may potentially compromise the anonymity of the submission (though it was after all the reviews were already in) https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_QxP1AZ&noteId=BJaIDpBEM\n", "decision": "Reject"}
