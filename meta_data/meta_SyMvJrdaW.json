{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes a \u201cwarp operator\u201d based on Taylor expansion that can replace a block of layers in a residual network, allowing for parallelization. Taking advantage of multi-GPU parallelization the paper shows increased speedup with similar performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. R1 asked for clarification on rotational symmetry. The authors instead removed the discussion that was causing confusion (replacing with additional experimental results that had been requested). R2 had the most detailed review and thought that the idea and analysis were interesting. They also had difficulty following the discussion of symmetry (noted above). They also pointed out several other issues around clarity and had several suggestions for improving the experiments which seem to have been taken to heart by the authors, who detailed their changes in response to this review. There was also an anonymous public comment that pointed out a \u201cfatal mathematical flaw and weak experiments\u201d. There was a lengthy exchange between this reviewer and the authors, and the paper was actually corrected and clarified in the process. This anonymous poster was rather demanding of the authors, asking for latex-formatted equations, pseudo-code, and giving direction on how to respond to his/her rebuttal. I don't agree with the point that the paper is flawed by \"only\" presenting a speed-up over ResNet, and furthermore the comment of \"not everyone has access to parallelization\" isn\u2019t a fair criticism of the paper.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
