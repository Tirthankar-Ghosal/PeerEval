{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper is generally very strong. I do find myself agreeing with the last reviewer though, that tuning hyperparameters on the test set should not be done, even if others have done it in the past. (I say this having worked on similar problems myself.) I would strongly encourage the authors to re-do their experiments with a better tuning regime.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
