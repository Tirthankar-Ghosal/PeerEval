{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper presents an interesting extension of the SkipThought idea by modeling sentence embeddings using several document-structure related information.  Out of the various kinds of evaluations presented, the coreference results are interesting -- but, they fall short by a bit (as noted by Reviewer 2) because they don't compare with recent work by Kenton Lee et al.  In summary, the idea provides an interesting bit on building sentence embeddings, but the experimental results could have been stronger.", "decision": "Reject"}
