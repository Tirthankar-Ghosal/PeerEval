{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The pros and cons of the paper can be summarized below:\n\nPro:\n* The improvements afforded by the method are significant over baselines, although these baselines are very preliminary baselines on a new dataset.\n\nCon\n* There is already a significant amount of work in using grammars to guide semantic parsing or code generation, as rightfully noted by the authors, and thus the approach in the paper is not extremely novel.\n* Because there is no empirical comparison with these methods, the relative utility of the proposed method is not clear.\n\nAs a result, I recommend that the paper not be accepted at this time.", "decision": "Reject"}
