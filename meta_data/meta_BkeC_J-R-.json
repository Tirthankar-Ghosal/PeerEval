{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The proposed method combines supervised pretraining given some expert data and further uses the supervision to regularize the Q-updates to prevent the agent from exploring 'nonsense' directions. There a significant problems with the paper: the approach is not novel, the assumption of large amounts of expert data is problematic, and the claim of vastly accelerated learning is not supported empirically, either in the main paper or in the additional mujoco experiments added in the appendix.", "decision": "Reject"}
