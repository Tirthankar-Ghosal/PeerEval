{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "In general, this seems like a sensible idea, but in my opinion the empirical results do not show a very compelling margin between using *entropy* as an active learning selection criterion vs the proposed methods. The difference is small enough that in practice it is very hard for me to believe that many researchers would choose to use the meta-learning via deep RL method (given that they'd need to train on multiple datasets and tune REINFORCE which is not going to be obviously easy). For that reason I am inclined to reject the paper.\n\nIn a follow-up version, I would heed the advice of Reviewer 1 and do more ablation analyses to understand the value of myopic vs non-myopic, cross-dataset vs. not, bandits vs RL, on the fly vs not (these are all intermingled issues). The relative lack of such analyses in the paper does not help in terms of it passing the bar.", "decision": "Reject"}
