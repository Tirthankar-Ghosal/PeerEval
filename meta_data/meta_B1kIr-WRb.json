{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers are concerned that the evaluation quality is not sufficient to convince readers that the proposed embedding method is indeed superior to alternatives. Though the authors attempted to address these comments in a subsequent revision but still, e.g., the evaluation is only intrinsic or on contrived problems. Given the limited novelty of the approach (it is a fairly straightforward generalization of Levy and Goldberg's factorization of PPMI matrix; the factorization is not new per se as well), the quality of experiments and analysis should be improved.\n\n+ the paper is well written\n- novelty is moderate\n- better evaluation and analysis are necessary\n", "decision": "Reject"}
