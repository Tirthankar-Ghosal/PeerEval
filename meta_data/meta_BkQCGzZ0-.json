{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents a different method for learning autoencoders with discrete hidden states (compared to recent discrete-like VAE type models). The reviewers in general like the method being proposed and are convinced that there is worth to the underlying proposal. However there are several shared complaints about the setup and writing of the paper.\n\n- Several reviewers complained about the use of qualitative evaluation, particularly in the \"Deciphering the latent code\" section of the paper.\n- One reviewer in particular had significant issues with the experimental setup of the paper and felt that there was insignificant quantitative evaluation, particularly using standard metrics for the task (compared to the metric introduced in the paper).\n- There were further critiques about the \"procedural\" nature of the writing and the lack of formal justifications for the ideas introduced.
