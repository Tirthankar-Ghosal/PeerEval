{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper shows that batch normalization can be cast as approximate inference in deep neural networks.  This is an appealing result as batch normalization is used in practice in a wide variety of models.   The reviewers found the paper well written and easy to understand and were motivated by underlying idea.  However, they found the empirical analysis lacking and found that there was not enough detail in the main text to verify whether the claims were true.\n\nThe authors empirically compared to a recent method showing that dropout can be cast as approximate inference with the claim that by transitivity they were comparing to a variety of recent methods.  AnonReviewer1 casts significant doubt on the results of that work.  This is very unfortunate and not the fault of the authors of this paper.  The authors have since gone to great length to compare to Louizos and Welling, 2017.  Unfortunately, that comparison doesn't appear to be complete in the manuscript.\n\nThe main text was also lacking specific detail relating to fundamental parts of the proposed method (noted by all reviewers).\n\nOverall, this paper seems to be tremendously promising and the underlying idea potentially very impactful.  However, given the reviews, it doesn't seem that this paper would achieve its potential impact.  The response from the authors is appreciated and goes a long way to improving the paper.  Taking the reviews into account, adding specific detail about the methodology and model (e.g. the prior) and completing careful empirical analysis will make this a strong paper that should be much more impactful.", "decision": "Reject"}
