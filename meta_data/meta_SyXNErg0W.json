{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a small modification to the loss on a network's softmax layer, which encourages the input to the softmax to be isotropic for each class.  This is motivated by applications where one may want to measure Euclidean distance between the feature vectors.  The main concern is that it's not clear that there is really a widespread need for this modified loss, i.e. that there are many applications (or a few very important ones) where one would want to train a network with a softmax layer but also need the Euclidean distances in the feature space to be sensible.", "decision": "Reject"}
