{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Though the general direction is interesting and relevant to ICLR, the novelty is limited. As reviewers point out it is very similar to Le & Zuidema (2015), with few modifications (using LSTM word representations, a different type of pooling). However, it is not clear if they are necessary  as there is no direct comparison (e.g., using a different type of pooling). Overall, though the submission is generally solid,  it does not seem appropriate for ICLR.\n\n+ solid\n+ well written\n- novelty limited\n- relation to Le & Zuidema is underplayed", "decision": "Reject"}
