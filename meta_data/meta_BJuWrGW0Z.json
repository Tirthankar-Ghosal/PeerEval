{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "PROS:\n\n1. Interesting and clearly useful idea\n2. The paper is clearly written.\n3. This work doesn't seem that original from an algorithmic point of view since Reed & De Freitas (2015) and Cai et. al (2017) among others have considered using execution traces. However the application to program repair is novel (as far as I know).\n4. This work can be very useful for an educational platform though a limitation is the need for adding instrumentation print statements by hand.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. The paper has some clarity issues which the authors have promised to fix.\n\n---", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
