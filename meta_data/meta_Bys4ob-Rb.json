{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper presents a differentiable upper bound on the performance of classifier on an adversarially perturbed example (with small perturbation in the L-infinity sense). The paper presents novel ideas, is well-written, and appears technically sound. It will likely be of interest to the ICLR community.\n\nThe only downside of the paper is its limited empirical evaluation: there is evidence suggesting that defenses against adversarial examples that work well on MNIST/CIFAR do not necessarily transfer well to much higher-dimensional datasets, for instance, ImageNet. The paper could, therefore, would benefit from empirical evaluations of the defenses on a dataset like ImageNet.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
