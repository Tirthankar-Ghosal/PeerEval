{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes an offline neural method using concrete/gumbel for learning a sparse codebook for use in NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and MT. The method outperforms other methods using pruning and other sparse coding methods, and also produces somewhat interpretable codes. Reviewers found the paper to be simple, clear, and effective. There was particular praise for the strength of the results and the practicality of application. There were some issues, such as only being applicable to input layers, and not being able to be applied end-to-end. The author also did a very admirable job of responding to questions about analysis with clear and comprehensive additional experiments. ", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
