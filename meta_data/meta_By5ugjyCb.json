{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "All of the reviewers agree that the experimental results are promising and the proposed activation function enables a decent degree of quantization. However, the main concern with the approach is its limited novelty compared to previous work on clipped activation functions.\n\nminor comments:\n- Even though PACT is very similar to Relu, the names are very different.\n- Please include a plot showing the proposed activation function as well.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
