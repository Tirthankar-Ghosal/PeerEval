{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Dear authors,\n\nThe reviewers appreciated your work and recognized the importance of theoretical work to understand the behaviour of deep nets. That said, the improvement over existing work (especially Montufar, 2017) is minor. This, combined with the limited attraction of such work, means that the paper will not be accepted.\n\nI acknowledge the major modifications done but it is up to the reviewers to decide whether or not they agree to re-review a significantly updated version.", "decision": "Reject"}
