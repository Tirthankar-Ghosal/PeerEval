{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper provides a method for eliminating options in multiple-answer reading comprehension tasks, based on the contents of the text, in order to reduce the \"answer space\" a machine reading model must consider. While there's nothing wrong with this, conceptually, reviewers have questioned whether or not this is a particularly useful process to include in a machine reading pipeline, versus having agents that understand the text well enough to select the correct answer (which is, after all, the primary goal of machine reading). Some reviewers were uncomfortable with the choice of dataset, suggesting SQuAD might be a better alternative), and why I am not sure I agree with that recommendation, it would be good to see stronger positive results on more than one dataset. At the end of the day, it is the lack of convincing experimental results showing that this method yields substantial improvements over comparable baselines which does the most harm to this well written paper, and I must recommend rejection.", "decision": "Reject"}
