{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper contains an interesting way to do online multi task learning, by borrowing ideas from active learning and comparing and contrasting a number of ways on the arcade learning environment.  Like the reviewers, I have some concerns about using the target scores and I think more analysis would be needed to see just how robust this method is to the choice/distribution of target scores (the authors mention that things don't break down as long as the scores are \"reasonable\", but that's not a particularly empirical nor precise statement).\n\nMy inclination is to accept the paper, because of the earnest efforts made by the authors in understanding how DUA4C works. However, I do agree that the paper should have a larger focus on that: basically Section 6 should be expanded, and the experiments should be rerun in such a way that the setup for DUA4C is more \"favorable\" (in terms of hyper-parameter optimization).  If there's any gap between any of the proposed methods and DUA4C, then this would warrant further analysis of course (since it would mean that there's an advantage to using target scores).
