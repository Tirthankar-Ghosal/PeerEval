{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "There was some debate between the authors and an anonymous commentator on this paper.  The feeling of the commentator was that existing work (mostly from the PL community) was not compared to appropriately and, in fact, performs better than this approach.  The authors point out that their evaluation is hard to compare directly but that they disagreed with the assessment.  They modified their texts to accommodate some of the commentator's concerns; agreed to disagree on others; and promised a fuller comparison to other work in the future.\n\nI largely agree with the authors here and think this is a good and worthwhile paper for its approach.\n\nPROS:\n1. well written\n2. good ablation study\n3. good evaluation including real bugs identified in real software projects\n4. practical for real world usage\n\nCONS:\n1. perhaps not well compared to existing PL literature or on existing datasets from that community\n2. the architecture (GGNN) is not a novel contribution", "decision": "Accept (Oral)"}
