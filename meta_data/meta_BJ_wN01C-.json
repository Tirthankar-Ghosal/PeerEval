{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Clearly explained, well motivated and empirically supported algorithm for training deep networks while simultaneously learning their sparse connectivity.\nThe approach is similar to previous work (in particular Welling et al., Bayesian Learning via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, ICML 2011) but is novel in that it satisfies a hard constraint on the network sparsity, which could be an advantage to match neuromorphic hardware limitations.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
