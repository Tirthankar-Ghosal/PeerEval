{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The pros and cons of this paper cited by the reviewers can be summarized below:\n\nPros:\n* The paper is a first attempt to investigate an under-studied area in neural MT (and potentially other applications of sequence-to-sequence models as well)\n* This area might have a large impact; existing models such as Google Translate fail badly on the inputs described here\n* Experiments are very carefully designed and thorough\n* Experiments on not only synthetic but also natural noise add significant reliability to the results\n* Paper is well-written and easy to follow\n\nCons:\n* There may be better architectures for this problem than the ones proposed here\n* Even the natural noise is not entirely natural, e.g. artificially constrained to exist within words\n* Paper is not a perfect fit to ICLR (although ICLR is attempting to cast a wide net, so this alone is not a critical criticism of the paper)\n\nThis paper had uniformly positive reviews and has potential for large real-world impact.", "decision": "Accept (Oral)"}
