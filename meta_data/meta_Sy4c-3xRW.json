{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes a general regularization algorithm which builds on the dropout idea. This is a very significant topic. The overall motivation is good, but the specific design choices are less well motivated over, for example, ad-hoc choices. Some concerns remain after the post-rebuttal discussion with the reviewers: the improvement is incremental in terms of concepts and methodology, the clarity needs to be improved and the experiments are somehow weak.\nIn summary, the main idea and research direction is interesting, but the attempted generality of the algorithm and the significance of the area call for a more clear and convincing presentation.\n", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
