{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Pros:\n+ The paper introduces a non-trivial interpretation of MAML as hierarchical Bayesian learning and uses this perspective to develop a new variation of MAML that accounts for curvature information.\n\nCons:\n- Relatively small gains over MAML on mini-Imagenet.\n- No direct comparison against the state-of-the-art on mini-Imagenet.\n\nThe reviewers agree that the interpretation of MAML as a form of hierarchical Bayesian learning is novel, non-trivial, and opens up an interesting direction for future research.  The only concerns are that the empirical results on mini-Imagenet do not show a particularly large improvement over MAML, and there is no direct comparison to the state-of-the-art results on the task.  However, the value of the new perspective on meta-learning outweighs these concerns.\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
