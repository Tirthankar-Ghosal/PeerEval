{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Thank you for submitting you paper to ICLR. Two of the reviewers are concerned that the paper\u2019s contributions are not significant enough \u2014either in terms of the theoretical or experimental contribution -- to warrant publication. The authors have improved the experimental aspect to include a more comprehensive comparison, but this has not moved the reviewers.\n\nSummary: The approach is very promising, but more experimental work is still required to demonstrate significance.
