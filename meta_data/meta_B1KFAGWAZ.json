{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The authors present a centralized neural controller for multi-agent reinforcement learning.   The reviewers are are not convinced that there is sufficient novelty, considering the authors setup as essentially a special case of other recent works, with added adjustments to the neural-networks that are standard in the literature.\n\nI personally am more bullish about this paper than the reviewers, as I think engineering an architecture to perform well in interesting scenarios is worth reporting.  However, the reviewers are mostly in agreement, and their reviews were neither sloppy nor factually incorrect.  So I will recommend rejection, following their judgement.\n\nNevertheless, I encourage the authors to continue strengthening the results and the presentation and resubmit.  ", "decision": "Reject"}
