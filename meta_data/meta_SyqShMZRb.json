{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents a more complex version of the grammar-VAE, which can be used to generate structured discrete objects for which a grammar is known, by adding a second 'attribute grammar', inspired by Knuth.\n\nOverall, the idea is a bit incremental, but the space is wide open and I think that structured encoder/decoders is an important direction.  The experiments seem to have been done carefully (with some help from the reviewers) and the results are convincing.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
