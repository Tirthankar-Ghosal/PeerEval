{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents a memory architecture for RL based on reservoir sampling, and is meant to be an alternative to RNNs. The reviewers consider the idea to be potentially interesting and useful, but have concerns about the mathematical justification. They also point out limitations in the experiments: in particular, use of artificial toy problems, and a lack of strong baselines. I don't think the paper is ready for ICLR publication in its current form.\n\n", "decision": "Reject"}
