{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper presents a boosting method and uses it to train an ensemble of convnets for image classification. The paper lacks conceptual and empirical comparisons with alternative boosting and ensembling methods. In fact, it is not even clear from the experimental results whether or not the proposed method outperforms a simple baseline model that averages the predictions of T independently trained convolutional networks.", "decision": "Reject"}
