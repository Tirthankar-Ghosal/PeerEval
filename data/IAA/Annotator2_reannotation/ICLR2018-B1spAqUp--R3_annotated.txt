"This paper proposed the new approach for feature upsampling called pixel deconvolution, which aims to resolve checkboard artifact of conventional deconvolution.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] By sequentially applying a series of decomposed convolutions, the proposed method explicitly enforces the model to consider the relation between pixels thus effectively improve the deconvolution network with an increased computational cost to some extent.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall, the paper is clearly written and easy to understand the main motivation and methods.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the checkboard artifact is a well-known problem of deconvolution network, and has been addressed by several approaches which are simpler than the proposed pixel deconvolution.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [DIS], [MAJ]] For example, it is well known that simple bilinear interpolation optionally followed by convolutions effectively removes checkboard artifact to some extent, and bilinear additive upsampling proposed in Wonja et al., 2017 also demonstrated its effectiveness as an alternative for deconvolution.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Comparisons against these approaches would make the paper stronger.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Besides, comparisons/discussions based on extensive analysis on various deconvolution architectures presented in Wonja et al., 2017 would also be interesting.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [SUB-NEU,CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nWonja et al, The Devil is in the Decoder, In BMVC, 2017[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n"
