"This paper proposes to train a classifier neural network not just to classifier, but also to reconstruct a representation of its input, in order to factorize the class information from the appearance (or \"style\" as used in this paper).[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This is done by first using unsupervised pretraining and then fine-tuning using a weighted combination of the regular multinomial NLL loss and a reconstruction loss at the last hidden layer.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Experiments on MNIST are provided to analyse what this approach learns.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nUnfortunately, I fail to see a significantly valuable contribution from this work.[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] First, the paper could do a better job at motivating the problem being addressed.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Why is it important to separate class from style?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] Should it allow better classification performance?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] If so, it's never measured in this work.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MAJ]] If that's not the motivation, then what is it?[[PDI-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nSecond, all experiments were conducted on the MNIST dataset.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In 2017, most would expect experiments on at least one other, more complex dataset, to trust any claims on a method.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nFinally, the results are not particularly impressive.[[RES-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I don't find the reconstructions demonstrated particularly compelling (they are generally pretty different from the original input).[[RES-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Also, that the \"style\" representation contain less (and I'd say slightly less, in Figure 7 b and d, we still see a lot of same class nearest neighbors) is not exactly a surprising result.[[RES-NEG,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] And the results of figure 9, showing poor reconstructions when changing the class representation essentially demonstrates that the method isn't able to factorize class and style successfully.[[MET-NEG,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The interpolation results of Figure 11 are also underwhelming, though possibly mostly because the reconstructions are in general not great.[[RES-NEG,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] But most importantly, none of these results are measured in a quantitative way: they are all qualitative, and thus subjective.[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nFor all these reasons, I'm afraid I must recommend this paper be rejected.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]"
