"Summary\n - This paper mainly focuses on a counting problem in visual question answering (VQA) using attention mechanism. [[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]The authors propose a differentiable counting component, which explicitly counts the number of objects.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Given attention weights and corresponding proposals, the model deduplicates overlapping proposals by eliminating intra-object edges and inter-object edges using graph representation for proposals.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In experiments, the effectiveness of proposed model is clearly shown in counting questions on both a synthetic toy dataset and the widely used VQA v2 dataset.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nStrengths\n - The proposed model begins with reasonable motivation and shows its effectiveness in experiments clearly.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n - The architecture of the proposed model looks natural and all components seem to have clear contribution to the model.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n - The proposed model can be easily applied to any VQA model using soft attention.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [DIS], [GEN]] \n - The paper is well written and the contribution is clear.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nWeaknesses\n - Although the proposed model is helpful to model counting information in VQA, it fails to show improvement with respect to a couple of important baselines: prediction from image representation only and from the combination of image representation and attention weights.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n - Qualitative examples of intermediate values in counting component--adjacency matrix (A), distance matrix (D) and count matrix (C)--need to be presented to show the contribution of each part, especially in the real examples that are not compatible with the strong assumptions in modeling counting component.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nComments\n - It is not clear if the value of count \"c\" is same with the final answer in counting questions.
