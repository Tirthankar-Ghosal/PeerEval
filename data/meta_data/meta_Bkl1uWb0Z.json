{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "In this work reviewers use structured attention as a way to induce grammatical structure in NMT models. Reviewers liked th motivation of the work and found experiments mostly well done. However reviewers found the paper a bit difficult to follow, with several commenting that distinctions made between the different sub types of attention were not clear. Mainly the reviewers were not overwhelmed by the results of the work, saying that these gains, while clearly isolated to the use of structure were not significantly large. Additionally there were some concerns about the claimed novelty of the work, particularly compared to Liu and Lapata and other use of syntax in translation, and also which aspects were new or necessary.
