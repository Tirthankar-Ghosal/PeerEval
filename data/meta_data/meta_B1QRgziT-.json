{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents impressive results on scaling GANs to ILSVRC2012 dataset containing a large number of classes. To achieve this, the authors propose \"spectral normalization\" to normalize weights and stabilize training which turns out to help in overcoming mode collapse issues.  The presented methodology is principled and well written. The authors did a good job in addressing reviewer's comments and added more comparative results on related approaches to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology. The reviewers agree that this is a great step towards improving the training of GANs.  I recommend acceptance.", "decision": "Accept (Oral)"}
