{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a method for learning connectivity in neural networks, evaluated on the ResNeXt architecture. The novelty of the method is rather limited, and even though the method has been shown to improve on the ResNeXt baselines on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet classification tasks (which is encouraging), it should have been evaluated on more architectures and datasets to confirm its generality.", "decision": "Reject"}
