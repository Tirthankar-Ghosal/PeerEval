{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes a method for refining distributional semantic representation at the lexical level. The reviews are fairly unanimous in that they found both the initial version of the paper, which was deemed quite rushed, and the substantial revision unworthy of publication in their current state. The weakness of both the motivation and the experimental results, as well as the lack of a clear hypothesis being tested, or of an explanation as to why the proposed method should work, indicates that this work needs revision and further evaluation beyond what is possible for this conference. I unfortunately must recommend rejection.", "decision": "Reject"}
