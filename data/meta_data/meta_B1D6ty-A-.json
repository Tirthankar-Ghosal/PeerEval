{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Pros:\n+ Interesting alternative algorithm for training autoencoders\n\nCons:\n- Not a lot of practical value because DANTE does not outperform SGD in terms of time or classification performance using autoencoder features.\n\nThis is an interesting and well-written paper that doesn't quite meet the threshold for ICLR acceptance. If the authors can find use cases where DANTE has demonstrable advantages over competing training algorithms, I expect the paper would be accepted.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
