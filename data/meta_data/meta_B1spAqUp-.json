{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper received borderline-negative reviews with scores of 5,5,6. A consistent issue was the weakness of the experiments: (i) lack of comparison to appropriate baselines, (ii) differences between published/reported numbers for DeepLab-ResNet (R3) and (iii) related work, e.g. Wojna paper, as raised by R1. The AC did not find the author's responses to these issues convincing. For (ii) the gap between 73 and 79 is large and the author's explanation for the difference doesn't seem plausible. For (iii), the response promised comparisons/discussion but there were not added to the draft.\n\nGiven this, the paper cannot be accepted in it current form. The experiments should be improved before the paper is resubmitted. ", "decision": "Reject"}
