{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper studies factorizations of convolutional kernels. The proposed kernels lead to theoretical and practical efficiency improvements, but these improvements are very, very limited (for instance, Figure 5). It remains unclear how they compare to popular alternative approaches such as group convolutions (used in ResNeXt) or depth-separable convolutions (used in MobileNet). The reviewers identify a variety of smaller issues with the manuscript.", "decision": "Reject"}
