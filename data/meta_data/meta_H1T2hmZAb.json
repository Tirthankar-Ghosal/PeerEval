{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper received mostly positive comments from experts. To summarize:\n\nPros:\n-- The paper provides complex counterparts for typical architectures / optimization strategies used by real valued networks.\nCons:\n-- Although the authors include plots explaining how nonlinearities transform phase, intuition about how phase gets processed can be improved.\n-- Improving evaluations: Wisdom et al. computes log magnitude; real valued networks may not be suited for computing real / complex numbers which have a large dynamic range, like the complex spectra. So please compare performance by estimating magnitude as in Wisdom et al.\n-- Please add computational cost, in terms of the number of multiplies and adds, to the final version of the paper.\n\nI am recommending that the paper be accepted based on these reviews.\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
