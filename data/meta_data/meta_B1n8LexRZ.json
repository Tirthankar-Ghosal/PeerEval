{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper presents a learned inference architecture which generalizes HMC. It defines a parameterized family of MCMC transition operators which share the volume preserving structure of HMC updates, which allows the acceptance ratio to be computed efficiently. Experiments show that the learned operators are able to mix significantly faster on some simple toy examples, and evidence is presented that it can improve posterior inference for a deep latent variable model. This paper has not quite demonstrated usefulness of the method, but it is still a good proof of concept for adaptive extensions of HMC.\n\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
