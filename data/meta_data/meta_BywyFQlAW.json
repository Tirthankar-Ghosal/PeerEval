{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The submission formulates self paced learning as a specific iterative mini-max optimization, which incorporates both a risk minimization step and a submodular maximization for selecting the next training examples.\n\nThe strengths of the paper lie primarily in the theoretical analysis, while the experiments are somewhat limited to simple datasets: News20, MNIST, & CIFAR10.  Additionally, the main paper is probably too long in its current form, and could benefit from some of the proof details being moved to the appendix.\n\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
