{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper analyzes mathematically why weights of trained networks can be replaced with ternary weights without much loss in accuracy. Understanding this is an important problem, as binary or ternary weights can be much more efficient on limited hardware, and we've seen much empirical success of binarization schemes. This paper shows that the continuous angles and dot products are well approximated in the discretized network. The paper concludes with an input rotation trick to fix discretization failures in the first layer.\n\nOverall, the contribution seems substantial, and the reviewers haven't found any significant issues. One reviewer wasn't convinced of the problem's importance, but I disagree here. I think the paper will plausibly be helpful for guiding architectural and algorithmic decisions. I recommend acceptance.\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
