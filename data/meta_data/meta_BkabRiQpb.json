{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewer reactions to the initial manuscript were generally positive.  They considered the paper to be well written and clear, providing an original contribution to learning to cooperate in multi-agent deep RL in imperfect domains.  The reviewers raised a number of specific issues to address, including improved definitions and descriptions, and proper citations of related work.  The authors have substantially  revised the manuscript to address most or all of these issues.  At this point, the only knock on this paper is that the findings seemed unsurprising from a game-theoretic or deep learning point of view.\n\nPros: algorithmic contribution, technical quality, clarity\nCons: no real surprises ", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
