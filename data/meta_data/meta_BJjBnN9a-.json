{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper received borderline negative scores: 5,6,4.\n\nThe authors response to R1 question about the motivations was \"...thus can achieve similar classification results with much smaller network sizes. This translates into smaller memory requirements, faster computational speeds and higher expressivity.\" If this is really the case, then some experimental comparison to compression methods (e.g. Song Han's PhD work at Stanford) is needed to back up this.\n\nR4 raises issues with the experimental evaluation and the AC agrees with them that they are disappointing. In general R4 makes some good suggestions for improving the paper.\n\nThe author's rebuttal also makes the general point that the paper should be accepted as it contains ideas, that these are sufficient alone: \"We strongly believe that with some fine-tuning it could achieve considerably better results, however we also believe that this is not the point in a first submission...\". The AC disagrees with this. Ideas are cheap. *Good ideas*, i.e. those that work, as in get good performance on standard benchmarks are valuable however. The reason for having benchmarks is to give some of objective way of seeing if an idea has any merit to it. So while the reviewers and the AC accept that the paper has some interesting ideas, this is not enough for warrant acceptance. ", "decision": "Reject"}
