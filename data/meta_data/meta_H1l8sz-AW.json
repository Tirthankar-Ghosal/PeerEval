{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Dear authors,\n\nDespite the desirable goal, that is to move away from regularization in parameter space toward regularization in function space, the reviewers all thought that the paper was not convincing enough, both in the choice of the particular regularization and in the experimental section.\n\nWhile I appreciate that you have done a major rework of the paper, the rebuttal period should not be used for that and we can not expect the reviewers to do a complete re-review of a new version.\n\nThis paper thus cannot be accepted to ICLR.", "decision": "Reject"}
