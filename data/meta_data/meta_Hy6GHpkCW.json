{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This work presents a RNN tailored to generate sketch drawings. The model has novel elements and advances specific to the considered task, and allows for free generation as well as generation with (partial) input. The results are very satisfactory. Importantly, as part of this work a large dataset of sketch drawings is released. The only negative aspect is the insufficient evaluation, as pointed out by R1 who points out the need for baselines and evaluation metrics. R1\u2019s concerns have been acknowledged by the authors but not really addressed in the revision. Still, this is a very interesting contribution.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
