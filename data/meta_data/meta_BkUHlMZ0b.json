{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes a new metric to evaluate the robustness of neural networks to adversarial attacks. This metric comes with theoretical guarantees and can be efficiently computed on large-scale neural networks.\n\nReviewers were generally positive about the strengths of the paper, especially after major revisions during the rebuttal process. The AC believes this paper will contribute to the growing body of literature in robust training of neural networks.  ", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
