{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Viewing language modeling as a matrix factorization problem, the authors argue that the low rank of word embeddings used by such models limits their expressivity and show that replacing the softmax in such models with a mixture of softmaxes provides an effective way of overcoming this bottleneck. This is an interesting and well-executed paper that provides potentially important insight. It would be good to at least mention prior work related to the language modeling as matrix factorization perspective (e.g. Levy & Goldberg, 2014).", "decision": "Accept (Oral)"}
