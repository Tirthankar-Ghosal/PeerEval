{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper builds on top of Cycle GAN ideas where the main idea is to jointly optimize the domain-level translation function with an instance-level matching objective. Initially the paper received two negative reviews (4,5) and a positive (7). After the rebuttal and several back and forth between the first reviewer and the authors, the reviewer was finally swayed by the new experiments. While not officially changing the score, the reviewer recommended acceptance. The AC agrees that the paper is interesting and of value to the ICLR audience.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
