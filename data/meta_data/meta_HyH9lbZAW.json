{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Thank you for submitting you paper to ICLR. The paper presents a general approach for handling inference in probabilistic graphical models that employ deep neural networks. The framework extends Jonhson et al. (2016) and Khan & Lin (2017). The reviewers are all in agreement that the paper is suitable for publication. The paper is well written and the use of examples to illustrate the applicability of the methods brings great clarity. The experiments are not the strongest suit of the paper and, although the revision has improved this aspect, I would encourage a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods. Nevertheless, this is a strong paper.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
