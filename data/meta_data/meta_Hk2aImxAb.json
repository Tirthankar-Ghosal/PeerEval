{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "As stated by reviewer 3 \"This paper introduces a new model to perform image classification with limited computational resources at test time. The model is based on a multi-scale convolutional neural network similar to the neural fabric (Saxena and Verbeek 2016), but with dense connections (Huang et al., 2017) and with a classifier at each layer.\"\nAs stated by reviewer 2 \"My only major concern is the degree of technical novelty with respect to the original DenseNet paper of Huang et al. (2017). \".  The authors assert novelty in the sense that they provide a solution to improve computational efficiency and focus on this aspect of the problem. Overall, the technical innovation is not huge, but I think this could be a very useful idea in practice.\n", "decision": "Accept (Oral)"}
