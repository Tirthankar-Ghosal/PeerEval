{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Well written paper on a novel application of the local reprarametrisation trick to learn networks with discrete weights. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results.\n\nNote: I apreciate that the authors added a comparison to the Gumbel-softmax continuous relaxation approach during the review period, following the suggestion of a reviewer. This additional comparison strengthens the paper.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
