{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Pros:\n+ The paper is very clearly written.\n+ The proposed re-embedding approach is easily implemented and can be integrated into fancier architectures.\n\nCons:\n- A lot of the gains reported come from lemmatization, and the gains from background knowledge become marginal when used on a stronger baseline (e.g., ESIM with full training data and full word vectors).\n\nThis paper is rather close to the decision boundary. The authors had reasonable answers for some of the reviewers' concerns, but in the end the reviewers were not completely convinced.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
