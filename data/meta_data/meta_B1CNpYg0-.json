{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The pros and cons of the paper can be summarized as follows:\n\nPros:\n* The method of combining together multiple information sources is effective\n* Experimental evaluation is thorough\n\nCons:\n* The method is a relatively minor contribution, combining together multiple existing methods to improve word embeddings. This also necessitates the model being at least as complicated as all the constituent models, which might be a barrier to practical applicability\n\nAs an auxiliary comment, the title and emphasis on computing embeddings \"on the fly\" is a bit puzzling. This is certainly not the first paper that is able to calculate word embeddings for unknown words (e.g. all the cited work on character-based or dictionary-based methods can do so as well). If the emphasis is calculating word embeddings just-in-time instead of ahead-of-time, then I would also expect an evaluation of the speed or memory requirements benefits of doing so. Perhaps a better title for the paper would be \"integrating multiple information sources in training of word embeddings\", or perhaps a more sexy paraphrase of the same.\n\nOverall, the method seems to be solid, but the paper was pushed out by other submissions.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
