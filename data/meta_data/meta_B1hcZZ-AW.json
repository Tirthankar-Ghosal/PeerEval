{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This is a meta-learning approach to model compression which trains 2 policies using RL to reduce the capacity (computational cost) of a trained network while maintaining performance, such that it can be effectively transferred to a smaller student network. The approach has similarities to recently proposed methods for architecture search, but is significantly different. The paper is well written and the experiments are clear and convincing. One of the reviews was unacceptable; I am not considering it (R1).", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
