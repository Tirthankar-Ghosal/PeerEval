{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This an interesting new contribution to construction of random features for approximating kernel functions. While the empirical results look promising, the reviewers have raised concerns about not having insights into why the approach is more effective;  the exposition of the quadrature method is difficult to follow; and the connection between the quadrature rules and the random feature map is never explicitly stated. Some comparisons are missing (e.g., QMC methods). As such the paper will benefit from a revision and is not ready for ICLR-2018 acceptance.", "decision": "Reject"}
