{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes a new generative model that has the stability of variational autoencoders (VAE) while producing better samples. The authors clearly compare their work to previous efforts that combine VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks with similar goals.  Authors show that the proposed algorithm is a generalization of Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) and minimizes Wasserstein distance between model and target distribution. The paper is well written with convincing results. Reviewers agree that the algorithm is novel and practical; and close connections of the algorithm to related approaches are clearly discussed with useful insights.  Overall, the paper is strong and I recommend acceptance.", "decision": "Accept (Oral)"}
