{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "I recommend acceptance based on the reviews. The paper makes novel contributions to learning one-hidden layer neural networks and designing new objective function with no bad local optima.\n\n There is one point that the paper is missing. It only mentions Janzamin et al in the passing. Janzamin et al propose using score function framework for designing alternative objective function. For the case of Gaussian input that this paper considers, the score function reduces to Hermite polynomials. Lack of discussion about this connection is weird. There should be proper acknowledgement of prior work. Also missing are some of the key papers on tensor decomposition and its analysis\n\nI think there are enough contributions in the paper for acceptance irrespective of the above aspect.
