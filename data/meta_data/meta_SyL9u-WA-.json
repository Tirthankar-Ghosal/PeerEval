{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Pros:\n+ Clearly written paper.\n+ Good theoretical analysis of the expressivity of the proposed model.\n+ Efficient model update is appealing.\n+ Reviewers appreciated the addition of results on the copy and adding tasks in Appendix C.\n\nCons:\n- Evaluation was on less-standard RNN tasks.  A language modeling task should have been included in the empirical evaluation because language modeling is such an important application of RNNs.\n\nThis paper is close to the decision boundary, but the reviewers strongly felt that demonstration of the method on a language modeling task was necessary for acceptance.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
