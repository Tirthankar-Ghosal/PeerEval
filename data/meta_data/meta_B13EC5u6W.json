{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a semi-supervised method to make deep learning more interpretable and at the same time be accurate on small datasets. The main idea is to learn dense representations from unlabelled data and then use those for building classifiers on small datasets as well as generate visual explanations. The idea is interesting, however, as one reviewer points out the presentation is poor. For instance, Table 2 is not understandable. Given the high standards of ICLR this cannot be ignored especially given the fact that the authors had the benefit of updating the paper which is a luxury for conference submissions.", "decision": "Reject"}
