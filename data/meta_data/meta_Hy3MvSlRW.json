{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper presents an adversarial learning framework for reading comprehension.  Although the idea is interesting and presents an approach that ideally would make reading comprehension approaches more robust, the results are not substantially solid (see reviewer 3's comments) compared to other baselines to warrant acceptance.  Comments from reviewer 2 are also noteworthy where they mention that adversarial perturbations to a context around an answer can alter the facts in the context, thus destroying the actual information present there, and the rebuttal does not seem to satisfy the concern.  Addressing these issues will strengthen the paper for a potential future venue.", "decision": "Reject"}
