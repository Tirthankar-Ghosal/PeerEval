{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "An interesting new approach for doing meta-learning incorporating temporal convolution blocks and soft attention. Achieves impressive SOTA results on few shot learning tasks and a number of RL tasks. I appreciate the authors doing the ablation studies in the appendix as that raises my confidence in the novelty aspect of this work. I thus recommend acceptance, but do encourage the authors to perform the ablation experiments promised to Reviewer 1 (especially the one to \"show how much SNAILs performance degrades when TCs are replaced with this method [of Vaswani et al.].\")", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
