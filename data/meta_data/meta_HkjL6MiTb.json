{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Reviewers unanimous in assessment that manuscript has merits, but does not satisfy criteria for publication.\n\nPros:\n- Potentially novel application of neural networks to survival analysis with competing risks, where only one terminal event from one risk category may be observed.\n\nCons:\n- Incomplete coverage of other literature.\n- Architecture novelty may not be significant.\n- Small performance gains (though statistically significant)", "decision": "Reject"}
