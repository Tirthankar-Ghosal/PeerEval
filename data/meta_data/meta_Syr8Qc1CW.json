{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The method proposed in the paper for latent disentanglement and attribute-conditional image generation is novel to the best of my understanding but reviewers (Anon1 and Anon3) have expressed concerns on the quality of results (CelebA images) as well as on the technical presentation and claims in the paper.\n\nGiven the novelty of the proposed method, I would *not* like to recommend a \"reject\" for this paper but the concerns raised by the reviewers on the quality of results and lack of quantitative results seem valid. Authors rule out possibility of any quantitative results in their response but I am not fully convinced -- in particular, effectiveness of attribute-conditional image generation can be captured by first training an attribute classifier on the generated images and then measuring how often the predicted attributes are flipped when conditioning signal is changed. There are also other metrics in the literature for evaluating generative models.\n\nI would recommend inviting it to the workshop track, given that the work is novel and interesting but has scope for improvements.\n", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
