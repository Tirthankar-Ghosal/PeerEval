{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The authors propose a technique for weight pruning that leaves block diagonal weights, instead of unstructured sparse weights, leading to faster inference.  However, the experiments demonstrating the quality of the pruned models are insufficient.   The authors also discuss connections to random matrix theory; but these connections are not worked out in detail.", "decision": "Reject"}
