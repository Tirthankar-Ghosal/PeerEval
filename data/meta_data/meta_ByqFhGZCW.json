{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper studies a adversarial attacks and defenses against convolutional networks based on a minimax formulation of the problem. Whilst this is an interesting direction of research, the present paper seems preliminary. In particular, compared to several other independent ICLR submissions, the empirical evaluation is quite weak: it does not consider the strongest known gradient-based attack (Carlini-Wagner) as baseline and does not report results on ImageNet. The reviewers identify several issues related to Lemma 1 and to the clarity of presentation.", "decision": "Reject"}
