{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "meta score: 4\n\nThe paper has been extensively edited during the review process - the edits are so extensive that I think the paper requires a re-review, which is not possible for ICLR 2018\n\nPros:\n - potentially interesting and novel approach to prefix encoding for character level CNN text classification\n - some experimental comparisons\nCons:\n - lacks good comparison with the state-of-the-art, which makes it difficult to determine conclusions\n - writing style lacks clarity.\n\nI would recommend that the authors continue to improve the paper and submit it to a later conference.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
