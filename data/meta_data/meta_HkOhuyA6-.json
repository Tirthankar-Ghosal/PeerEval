{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The submission proposes a strategy for creating vector representations of graphs, upon which a CNN can be applied.  Although this is a useful problem to solve, there are multiple works in the existing literature for doing so.  Given that the choice between these is essentially empirical, a through comparison is necessary.  This was pointed out in the reviews, and relevant missing comparisons were given.  The authors did not provide a response to these concerns.", "decision": "Reject"}
