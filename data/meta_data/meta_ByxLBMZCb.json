{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper nicely unifies previous results and develops the property of local openness. While interesting, I find the application to multi-layer linear networks extremely limiting. There appears to be a sub-field in theory now focusing on solely multi-layer linear networks which is meaningless in practice. I can appreciate that this could give rise to useful proof techniques and hence, I am recommending it to the workshop track with the hope that it can foster more discussions and help researchers move away from studying multi-layer linear networks.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
