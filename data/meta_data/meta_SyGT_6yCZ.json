{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper addresses the training time of CNNs, in the common setting where a CNN is trained on one domain and then used to extract features for another domain.  The paper proposes to speed up the CNN training step via a particular proposed training schedule with a reduced number of epochs.  Training time of the pre-trained CNN is not a huge concern, since this is only done once, but optimizing training schedules is a valid and interesting topic of study.   However, the approach here does not seem novel; it is typical to adjust training schedules according to the desired tradeoff between training time and performance.  The experimental validation is also thin, and the writing needs improvement.", "decision": "Reject"}
