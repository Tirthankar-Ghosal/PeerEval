{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Authors apply dense nets and LSTM to model dependencies among labels and demonstrate new state-of-art performance on an X-Ray dataset.\n\nPros:\n- Well written.\n- New improvement to state-of-art\n\nCons:\n- Novelties are not strong. One combination of existing approaches are used to achieve state-of-art on what is still a relatively new dataset. (All Reviewers)\n\n- Using LSTM to model dependencies would be affected by the selected order of the disease states. In this sense, LSTM seems like the wrong architecture to use to model dependencies among labels. This may be a drawback in comparison to other methods of modeling dependencies, but this is not thoroughly discussed or evaluated. (Reviewer 1 & 3)\n\n- There is a large body of work on multi-task learning with shared information, which have not been evaluated for comparison. Because of this, the contribution of the LSTM to model dependencies between labels in comparison to other available approaches cannot be verified. (Reviewer 1 & 3)\n\n- Top AUC performance on this dataset does not carry much significance on its own, as the dataset is new (CVPR 2017), and few approaches have been tested against it.\n\n- Medical literature not cited to justify with evidence the discovered dependencies among disease states. (Reviewer 1)\n\n", "decision": "Reject"}
