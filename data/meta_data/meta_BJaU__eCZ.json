{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The submission proposes to use GANs to learn a generative model of fMRI scans that can then be used for downstream classification tasks.  Although there was some appreciation from the reviewers of the approach, there were several important remaining concerns:\n\n1) From Reviewer 1: \"Generating high resolution images with GANs even on faces for which there is almost infinite data is still a challenge. Here a few thousand data points are used. So it raises too concerns: First is it enough?\"\n\nand\n\n2) R1 and R2 both raised concerns about the significance of the improvements.  Looking through the tables, there are many reported differences that are reasonably small, and no error bars or significance are given.  This should be a requirement for an empirical paper about fMRI.", "decision": "Reject"}
