{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Thank you for submitting you paper to ICLR. The revision improved the paper e.g. moving Appendix A3 to the main text has improved clarity, but, like reviewer 3, I still found section 4 hard to follow. As the authors suggest, shifting the terminology to \"posterior shifting\u201d rather than \u201csharpening\" would help at a high level, but the design choices should be more carefully explained. The experiments are interesting and promising. The title, although altered, still seems a misnomer given that the experimental evaluation focusses on RNNs.\n\nSummary: There is the basis of a good paper here, but the rationale for the design choices should be more carefully explained.", "decision": "Reject"}
