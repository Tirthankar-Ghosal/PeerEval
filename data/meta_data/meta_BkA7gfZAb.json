{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "All the reviewers noted that the dual formulation, as presented, only applies to the logistic family of classifiers. The kernelization is of course something that *can* be done, as argued by the authors, but is not in fact approached in the submission, only in the rebuttal. The toy-ish nature of the problems tackled in the submission limits the value of the presentation.\n\nIf the authors incorporate their domain adaptation results (SVHN-->MNIST and others) using the kernelized approach and do the stability analysis for those cases, and obtain reasonable results on domain adaptation benchmarks (70% on SVHN-->MNIST is for instance on the low side compared to the pixel-transfer-based GAN approaches out there!) then I think it'd be a great paper.\n\nAs such, I can only recommend it as an invitation to the workshop track, as the dual formulation is interesting and potentially useful.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
