{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers concerns regarding novelty and the experimental evaluation have been resolved accordingly and all recommend acceptance.

Clustering is, by default, assumed to be unsupervised.\n\nThere is some interest in extending this to non-vision domains, however this is beyond the scope of the current work.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
