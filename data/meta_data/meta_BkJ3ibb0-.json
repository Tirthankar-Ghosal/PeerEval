{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper studied defenses against adversarial examples by training a GAN and, at inference time, finding the GAN-generated sample that is nearest to the (adversarial) input example. Next, it classifies the generated example rather than the input example. This defense is interesting and novel. The CelebA experiments the authors added in their revision suggest that the defense can be effective on high-resolution RGB images.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
