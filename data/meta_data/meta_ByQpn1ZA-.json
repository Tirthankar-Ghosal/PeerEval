{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "AnonReviewers 2 and AnonReviewer 3 rated the paper highly, with AR3 even upgrading their score.  AnonReviewer1 was less generous:\n\n\" Overall, it is a good empirical study, raising a healthy set of questions. In this regard, the paper is worth accepting. However, I am still uncomfortable with the lack of answers and given that the revision does not include the additional discussion and experiments promised in the rebuttal, I will stay with my evaluation.\"\n\nThe authors have promised to produce the discussion and new experiments. Given the nature of both (1: the discussion is already outline in the response and 2: the experiments are straightforward to run), I'm inclined to accept the paper because it represents a solid body of empirical work.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
