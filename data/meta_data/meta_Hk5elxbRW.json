{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The submission proposes a loss surrogate for top-k classification, as in the official imagenet evaluation.  The approach is well motivated, and the paper is very well organized with thorough technical proofs in the appendix, and a well presented main text.  The main results are: 1) a theoretically motivated surrogate, 2) that gives up to a couple percent improvement over cross-entropy loss in the presence of label noise or smaller datasets.\n\nIt is a bit disappointing that performance is limited in the ideal case and that it does not more gracefully degrade to epsilon better than cross entropy loss.  Rather, it seems to give performance epsilon worse than cross-entropy loss in an ideal case with clean labels and lots of data.  Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction for optimizing the error measure to be used during evaluation.  The reviewers uniformly recommended acceptance.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
