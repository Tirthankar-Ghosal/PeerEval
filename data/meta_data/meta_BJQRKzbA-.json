{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "PROS:\n1. Overall, the paper is well-written, clear in its exposition and technically sound.\n2. With some caveats, an independent team concluded that the results were \"largely reproducible\"\n3. The key idea is a smart evolution scheme. It circumvents the traditional tradeoff between search space size and complexity of the found models.\n4. The implementation seems technically sound.\n\nCONS:\n1. The results were a bit over-stated (the authors promise to correct)\n2. Could benefit from more comparison with other approaches (e.g. RL)", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
