{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "I appreciate the experimental results, which includes a comparison against several baselines, however, I echo some of the concerns raised by the reviewers that the formulation is unclear and hard to follow. Moreover, the novelty over [Nachum, 2017] and [Haarnoja, 2017] seems small. Especially because [Nachum, 2017] also used expert trajectories to improve the performance in their experiments.\n\nDetailed comment:\nThe use of log-sum-exp state values is only valid for the optimal policy, so it is not clear how an on-policy state value is replaced with the log-sum-exp state value. Also, because the equations that you derive characterize the optimal policy, I am not sure if you need importance correction at all.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
