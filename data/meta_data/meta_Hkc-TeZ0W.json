{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The authors provide an alternative method to [1] for placement of ops in blocks. The results are shown to be an improvement over prior RL based placement in [1] and superior to *some* (maybe not the best) earlier methods for operations placements. The paper seems to have benefited strongly from reviewer feedback and seems like a reasonable contribution. We hope that the implementation may be made available to the community.\n\n[1] Mirhoseini A, Pham H, Le Q V, et al.
