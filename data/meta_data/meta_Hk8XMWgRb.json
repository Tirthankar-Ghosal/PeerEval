{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "New effective kernel learning methods are very well aligned with ICLR's focus on Representation Learning. As a reviewer pointed out, not all aspects of the paper are algorithmically \"clean\". However, the proposed approach is natural and appears to give consistent improvements over a couple of expected baselines. The paper could be strengthened with more comparisons against other kernel learning methods, but acceptance at ICLR-2018 will increase the diversity of the conversation around advances in Representation Learning.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
