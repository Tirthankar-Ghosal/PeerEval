{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a method to generate adversaries close to the (training) data manifold using GANs rather than arbitrary adversaries. They show the effectiveness of their method in terms of human evaluation and success in fooling a deep network. The reviewers feel that this paper is for the most part well-written and the contribution just about makes the mark.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
