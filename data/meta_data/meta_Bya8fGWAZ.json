{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper and reviews makes for a difficult call.  The reviewers appear to be in agreement that Value Propagation provides an interesting algorithmic advance over earlier work on Value Iteration networks.  AnonReviewer1 gives a strong rationale why the advance is both original and significant.  Their experiments also show very nice results with VProp and MVProp in 2-D grid-worlds.\n\nHowever, I also fully agree with AnonReviewer2 that testing in other domains beyond 2-D grid-world is necessary.  Earlier work on VIN was also tested on a Mars Rover / continuous control domain, as well as graph-based web navigation task.  The authors' rebuttal on this point comes across as weak.  In their view, they can't tackle real-world domains until VProp has been proven effective in large, complex grid-worlds.  I don't buy this at all -- they could start initial experiments right away, which would perhaps yield some surprising results. Given this analysis, the committee recomments this paper for workshop.\n\nPros: significant algorithmic advance, good technical quality and writeup, nice results in 2-D grid world.\n\nCon: Validation is only in 2-D grid-world domains.
