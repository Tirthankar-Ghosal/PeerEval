{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Generally solid engineering work but a bit lacking in terms of novelty and some issues with clarity. At the end of the day the empirical gains are not sufficient for acceptance - the results are state-of-the-art relative to published work, but not in the top 10 based on the official leaderboard (not even at time of submission). Since the technical contributions are small and the engineering contributions have been made obsolete by concurrent work, I suggest rejection.", "decision": "Reject"}
