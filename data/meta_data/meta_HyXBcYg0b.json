{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The authors make an experimental study of the relative merits of RNN-type approaches and graph-neural-network approaches to solving node-labeling problems on graphs.   They discuss various improvements in gnn constructions, such as residual connections.\n\nThis is a borderline paper.  On one hand, the reviewers feel that there is a place for this kind of empirical study, but on the other, there is agreement amongst the reviewers that the paper is not as well written as it could be.  Furthermore, some reviewers are worried about the degree of novelty (of adding residual connections to X).\n\nI will recommend  rejection, but urge the authors to clarify the writing and expand on the empirical  study and resubmit.
