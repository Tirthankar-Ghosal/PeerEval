{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "All of the reviewers agree that the paper clearly presents promising ideas in developing a novel actor critic algorithm. The experiments do not show a significant gain against the baselines, but they support the presented ideas. I appreciated the ablation study on dual-AC.\n\nDetailed comments:\nMy understanding is that the x-axis in Figures 1 & 2 shows the number of iterations each of which contains batch_size*1000 environment steps. It is more standard to show those plots in terms of the number of environment steps. Further, the optimal batch_size for different algorithms may be different, so using the same batch_size for all of the algorithms is not fair.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
