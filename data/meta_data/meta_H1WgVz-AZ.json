{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The submission modifies the SPEN framework for structured prediction by adding an inference network in place of the usual combinatorial optimization based inference.  The resulting architecture has some similarity to a GAN, and significantly increases the speed of inference.\n\nThe submission provides links between two seemingly different frameworks: SPENs and GANs.  By replacing inference with a network output, the connection is made, but importantly, this massively speeds up inference and may mark an important step forward in structured prediction with deep learning.
