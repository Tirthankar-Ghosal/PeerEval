{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Observing that in contrast to classical information bottleneck, the deep variational information bottleneck (DVIB) model is not invariant to monotonic transformations of input and output marginals, the authors show how to incorporate this invariance along with sparsity in DVIB using the copula transform. The revised version of the paper addressed some of the reviewer concerns about clarity as well as the strength of the experimental section, but the authors are encouraged to improve these aspects of the paper further.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
