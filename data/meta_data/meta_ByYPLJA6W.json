{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a method to map input probability distributions to output probability distributions with few parameters. They show the efficacy of their method on synthetic and real stock data. After revision they seemed to have added another dataset, however, it is not carefully analyzed like the stock data. More rigorous experimentation needs to be done to justify the method.", "decision": "Reject"}
