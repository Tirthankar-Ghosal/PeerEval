{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The authors use the Cayley transform representation of an orthogonal matrix to provide a parameterization of an RNN with orthogonal weights.   The paper is clearly written and the formulation is simple and elegant.  However,  I share the concerns of reviewer 3 about the significance of another method for parameterizing orthogonal RNN, as there has not been a lot of evidence that these have been useful on real problems (and indeed, on most of the toys used show the value of orthogonal RNN, one can get good results just by orthogonal initialization, e.g. as in Henaff et. al. as cited in this work).    This work does not compare experimentally against many of the other methods, e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00188.pdf,  the two Jing et. al. works cited, simple projection methods (either full projections at each step or stochastic projections as in Henaff et. al.).  It does not cite or compare against the approach in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04903.pdf.  ", "decision": "Reject"}
