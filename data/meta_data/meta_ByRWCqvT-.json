{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Pros\n-- A novel formulation for cross-task and cross-domain transfer learning.\n-- Extensive evaluations.\n\nCons\n-- Presentation a bit confusing, please improve.\n\nThe paper received positive reviews from reviewers. But the reviewers pointed out some issues with presentation and flow of the paper. Even though the revised version has improved, the AC feels that it can be improved further. For example, as pointed out by reviewers, different parts of the model are trained using different losses and / or are pre-trained. It would be worth clarifying that. It might help if the authors include a pseudocode / algorithm block to the final version of the paper.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
