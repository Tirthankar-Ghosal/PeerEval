{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The reviewers agree that the idea of utilizing covariance information in the few-shot setting is interesting. There are concerns with the novelty of the paper, as well as the correctness in terms of ensuring the covariance matrix is PSD in all cases. There are some concerns with the experimental evaluation as well. In this area, Omniglot is a good sanity check, but other baseline datasets like miniImagenet are necessary to determine if this approach is truly useful.", "decision": "Reject"}
