{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper received scores of 8 (R1), 6 (R2), 6 (R3). R1's review is brief, and also is optimistic that these results demonstrated on ConvACs generalize to real convnets.  R2 and R3 feel this might be a potential problem. R2 advocates weak accept and given that R1 is keen on the paper, the AC feels it can be accepted.\n\n", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
