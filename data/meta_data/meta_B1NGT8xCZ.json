{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Pros\n-- Nice way to formulate domain adaptation in a Bayesian framework that explains why autoencoder and domain difference losses are useful.\n\nCons\n-- Model closely follows the framework, but the overall strategy is similar to previous models (but with improved rationale).\n-- Experimental section can be improved. It would interesting to explore and develop the relationship between the proposed technique and Tzeng et al.\n\nGiven the aforementioned cons, the AC is recommending that the paper be rejected.\n", "decision": "Reject"}
