{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper proposes to pre-train a feature embedding, using Siamese networks, for use with few-shot learning for SVMs.  The idea is not very novel since there is a fairly large body of work in the general setting of pre-trained features + simple predictor.  In addition, the experimental results could be stronger -- there are stronger results in the literature (not cited), and better data sets for testing few-shot learning.", "decision": "Reject"}
