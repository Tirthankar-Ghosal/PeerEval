{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "Biological memory systems are grounded in spatial representation and spatial memory, so neural methods for spatial memory are highly interesting. The proposed method is novel, well-designed and the empirical results are good on unseen environments, although the noise model may be too weak. Moreover, it would have been great to evaluate this method on real data rather than in simulation. ", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
