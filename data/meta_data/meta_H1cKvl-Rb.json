{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The idea studied here is interesting, if incremental. The empirical results are not particularly stellar, but it's clear that the authors have done their best to provide reproducible and defensible results. A few sticking points: a) The use of the term 'UCB', as mentioned in an anonymous comment, is somewhat misleading. \"Approximate Confidence Interval\" might be less controversial; b) there are a number of recent research results on exploration that are worth paying attention to (Plappert et al, O'Donoghue et al.) and worth comparing to, and c) the theoretical results are not always justified or useful (e.g. Equation 9: the bound is trivial, posterior >= 0 or 1).
