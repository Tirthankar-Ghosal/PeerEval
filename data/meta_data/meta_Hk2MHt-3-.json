{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper studies end-to-end training of a multi-branch convolutional network. This appears to lead to strong accuracies on the CIFAR and SVHN datasets, but it remains unclear whether or not this results transfers to ImageNet. The proposed approach is hardly novel, and lacks a systematic comparison with \"regular\" ensembling methods and with related mixture-of-experts approaches (for instance: S. Gross et al. Hard Mixtures of Experts for Large Scale Weakly Supervised Vision, 2017; Shazeer et al. Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer, 2017).", "decision": "Reject"}
