{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a new deep architecture based on polar transformation for improving rotational invariance. The proposed method is interesting and the experimental results strong classification performance on small/medium-scale datasets (e.g., rotated MNIST and its variants with added translations and clutters, ModelNet40, etc.). It will be more impressive and impactful if the proposed method can bring performance improvement on large-scale, real datasets with potentially cluttered scenes (e.g., Imagenet, Pascal VOC, MS-COCO, etc.).", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}
