{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The main idea of the paper is to transform graph classification into image representation (via adjacency matrices). Two reviewers are positive, while one is negative. The concerns are novelty (as mentioned by R2), while the last reviewer thinks the method is too simple and unprincipled (here the AC agrees with authors that simple is not necessarily bad). Overall, none of the reviewers champions this paper. Due to many excellent submissions, unfortunately this paper cannot be accepted in present form.", "decision": "Reject"}
