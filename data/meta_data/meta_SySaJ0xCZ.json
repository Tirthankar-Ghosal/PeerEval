{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "The paper proposes a method for architecture search using network morphisms, which allows for faster search without retraining candidate models. The results on CIFAR are worse than the state of the art, but reasonably competitive, and achieved using limited computation resources. It would have been interesting to see how the method would perform on large datasets (ImageNet) and/or other tasks and search spaces. I would encourage the authors to extend the paper with further experimental evaluation.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
