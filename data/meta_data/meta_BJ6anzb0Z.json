{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This work combines words and images from Tumblr to provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis than just positive-negative. The contribution is too slight, as a straightforward combination of existing architectures applied on an emotion classification task with conclusions that aren't well motivated and are not providing any comparison to existing related work on finer emotion classification.", "decision": "Reject"}
