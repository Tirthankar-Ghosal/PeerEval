{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This work proposes an improved visualisation techniques for ReLU networks that compensates for filter scale symmetries/invariances, thus allowing a more meaningful comparison of low-dimensional projected optimization landscapes between different network architectures.\n\n- the visualisation techniques are a small variation over previous works\n+ extensive experiments provide nice visualisations and yield a clearer visual picture of some properties of the optimization landscape of various architectural variants\n\nA promising research direction, which could be further improved by providing more extensive and convincing support for the significance of its contribution in comparison to prior techniques, and to its empirically derived observations, findings and claims.\n", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
