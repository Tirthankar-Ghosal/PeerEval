{"title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision", "comment": "This paper attempts a theoretical treatment of the influence of depth in RNNs on their ability to capture dependencies in the data. All reviewers found the theoretical contribution of the paper interesting, and while there were problems raised regarding formalisation, they appear to have been adequately addressed in the revisions to the paper. The main concern in all three reviews surrounds the evaluation, and weakness thereof. The overarching point of contention seems to be that the theory relates to a particular formulation of RNNs (RAC), causing doubts that the results lift to other architectural variants which are used to obtain state-of-the-art results on tasks such as language modelling. It seems that the paper could be significantly improved by the provision of stronger empirical results to support the theory, or a more convincing argument as to why the results should transfer from, say, RAC to LSTMs. The authors point to two papers on the matter in their response, but it is not clear this is a substitute for experimental validation. I find the paper a bit borderline because of this, and recommend redirection to the workshop.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}
